poor aunt , she' s so dumb .
we' re gonna get all her stones , right dad ?
listen , brat !
i won' t rest until every single stone is in san bartolo .
but they' re ours , aren' t they ?
shut up !
don' t tell me the lady' s been thrashing you !
my god !
you' re hurt .
come , take a seat .
easy now .
i' il get you some medicine .
can i have your newspaper ?
here' s the healing medicine .
see what young girls are up to nowadays !
it' s done .
try not to touch the wound .
can you get me another mezcal ?
get me more pulque , son !
juan lopez perez , at your service .
i' m the judge' s deputy .
congratulations !
thank you .
who' s gonna sing us another song ?
come on ...
give her a hug , man !
is the pulque alright , sir ?
it' s very good .
vicente , what are the lady' s nephew' s plans regarding her house ?
you know who i mean , that fatso with the dumb gringo cap .
juan luis .
you' re drunk !
juan luis from san bartolo ?
if i' d known i wouldn' t have asked , shithead !
i' m sorry , senator .
i' m quite pissed off .
but not with you .
san bartolo is the village in the middle of the canyon ?
yes .
and juan luis works with the butcher ?
yes .
senora .
they' re taking the house tomorrow .
senora , you' re being conned .
in the early afternoon .
that man has no right to this house .
how long have you lived here ?
it was his grandfather' s .
how many years have you lived in this house ?
only about 40 .
then it' s yours , no one can take it from you .
juan luis won' t take my house , he just wants the stones .
he needs them more than i do .
i don' t mind .
what do you mean you don' t mind !
you said your hut wouldn' t resist the april winds without the barn !
i' m not a greedy person .
why are you crying then ?
because i know what i want .
you haven' t a clue of what you want .
only yesterday i heard juan luis ' sons mocking you .
shut up , please .
i' m doing laundry .
shall i wash your clothes ?
good afternoon , senora .
good afternoon , fernando .
just a little favour , would you undo my shoelaces ?
my daughter is up the hill , looking after her aunt' s sheep .
they asked for her help ' cause there' s a lot to do .
i never deny my daughter' s services .
i lend her .
you might see her up there , near your house .
yes , fernando .
i might .
thanks .
have a good day .
see you later , god willing .
senora !
senora , please excuse my harshness this morning .
oh sir !
i know you' re only trying to help .
have you seen the sunset , ascen ?
the best things in life can' t be bought , right ?
i really couldn' t say , but it' s great you found my blouse .
it was a present from sabi .
sure , sure .
ascen , i want to make you a proposal ... to explain something to you .
fine , but first tell me why you came to this place .
alright .
to be calm .
cause there' s a lot of trouble in the city ?
yeah .
but it isn' t just that .
much serenity is necessary to leave behind the things we' re used to and don' t really like anymore .
we must learn to dispose of what' s useless .
but it' s better to fix things than throw them out .
sure , but certain things can' t be fixed .
disposing of them is better than clinging to them out of habit .
i think i understand , sir .
but you know , sir ... even though i don' t like my sick , old arms ,
i wouldn' t chop them off .
sure , i get you .
by the way , what was it you wanted to tell me ?
yes , the proposal .
listen , i' d like you to hear some music and then i' il tell you .
ascen ...
senora ...
is it almost over ?
i want to tell you what it' s about .
let me listen a little more .
is it over ?
tell me now what you wanted to tell me .
take off the earphones .
remember i told you how i need a lot of ... serenity in order to make a decision ?
sure , all about disposing of things .
more or less .
i know you' re an elderly person from a remote canyon ... and this might sound a bit strange .
but in fact ... it' s totally normal if you think for a while .
tell me now what you have to say !
forgive me , but i don' t follow you .
don' t worry .
while searching for that serenity , other emotions came up , other instincts .
what i would like is to have intercourse with you .
there' s more to it than that , but that' s what it is .
i' d like to if you' d like to .
free intercourse ?
pardon ?
you tell me .
well ... sexual intercourse .
it' s important for me now .
but don' t you see i' m very old ?
i don' t mind .
weren' t you in a hurry to leave ?
i will go tomorrow for good .
but first i need this .
so you want to fornicate me right now ?
it doesn' t have to be right now .
before the end of tomorrow ?
that' s fine .
thank you , senora .
i' d like it to be tomorrow , ok ?
whenever you like .
good night .
good night .
peace be with you .
peace be with you .
lie down , senora .
come closer .
now turn around , please .
may i keep touching you like this ?
you must come closer .
now turn around .
you must lift yourself up .
come closer .
a bit more .
fine .
now turn around .
put your knee here .
lift that up .
your other knee here .
do lift up .
lift up !
now get on your knees .
on your knees .
on your knees !
as if ... fine .
further back now .
better if you turn around .
what' s going on ?
how dare you take the lady' s house from her ?
you fucking bunch of cowards !
how could you leave her like that ?
shut up , sir !
what' s going on here ?
don' t shout here !
get him out of here , senora !
go back to where you belong , foreigner !
get out of here !
and calm down !
silence !
you shouldn' t have hurt him , now he' s crippled .
back to where he belongs !
come on , get to work !
and sweat !
pull hard now !
here' s some more pulque .
thanks , young man !
you' re falling asleep .
who' s gonna get us the drinks ?
they don' t give us much .

i carved your name on the maguey' s bark ... together side by side ... two hearts together ... you know that my heart ... is so big .
and i' m proud ... from the bottom of my heart .
now you say you don' t care ... because you' ve been told ... the story of my love .
and now you know ... that i' m at peace ... because you wanted ... to be my sweetheart .
