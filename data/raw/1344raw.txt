richard ?
is that you ?
did you bring the pom poms ?
i brought something to help you sleep .
what the fuck ? !
my physics test .
i got a b+ .
you are a genius .
don' t .
i have something for you .
what is this ?
you' re quite the slut .
what ?
what ? !
how long has he been here ?
nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4 .
how are you feeling ?
i' m okay .
i' m a little sore , but ....
what are you doing here ?
i figured you' d want an immediate report .
yeah , i do .
so ?
we got everything .
excellent .
the boots ?
that' s an affirmative .
and a pair of tin snips , and a phillips head , traces of blood .
and a finger , right ?
was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines ... ... or in the freezer under the turkey thigh ?
behind the vanilla fudge ice cream .
good work .
all you need now is a confession .
there won' t be one .
feathers committed suicide last night .
suicide ?
yeah .
it was a gun to the head .
powder burns , gsr on his right hand .
ever heard of a ritual mutilator , an impulsive serial type killer ... ... committing suicide ?
don' t do that .
i can' t think of one .
psychos want to get caught .
lie down .
i' m actually feeling a lot better , thank you .
these kids did this .
they' re not even hiding it .
they want us to know .
so let' s get to know them a little better .
turn around .
we got ray on this .
why did he run if he didn' t do it ?
there' s a reason .
are you jealous because i got him ... ... or are you so obsessed with richard you' re not thinking ?
i' m sorry
you' ve been angling for this for a while , taking over the case !
they made me take it because they think you' re losing it !
who thinks i' m losing it ?
who ?
rod ?
i don' t care if i' m losing it .
i' m right .
how did you come by this ?
it was the weirdest thing .
i was driving by the house ... ... the trash can got knocked over , and the stuff fell out .
what a break .
some of this will be the mom' s , some will be the boy' s .
what is this ?
don' t ask , don' t tell .
we won' t know until we get the report if it matches the puke' s dna .
lucky he gave us some blood with his dinner .
be sure to get a signed purchase order .
when will we know ?
depends on the lab .
want me to call him ?
no !
last time i had to calm him down .
just make it fast .
i' il take care of it .
see you .
what' s this ?
a purchase order for the dna  i know what it is .
this case is closed .
closed !
now , if you can' t understand that , then maybe we
you need some time off ?
nope , i' m fine .
you' re not fine .
you' re brilliant sometimes , but never really fine .
you want to see doc sluzer again ?
no .
then no more on this case .
not another minute , not another penny .
i' ve about had it with you .
you hear me ?
hi , it' s cass .
i' il need another day or two on that purchase order .
no , just bookkeeping , changing the software , things like that .
so you' il run an analysis on that puke ?
thanks , honey .
i' m sorry .
i shouldn' t have done it .
come on !
you threw up ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
i don' t remember doing it .
he doesn' t remember .
what if they i. d. you ?
with the dna , can they do that ?
i doubt it .
the stomach acids usually eat away
you doubt it ?
i doubt it .
it could put us in the electric chair !
gas chamber .
what ?
california uses a gas chamber .
that' s very informative .
it doesn' t matter .
no , thank you .
you told her you tutor me too ?
what are you thinking ?
if she found out on her own ... ... and i hadn' t mentioned it , it would look even worse !
they have nothing .
they have nothing on me .
don' t worry , i' m not a backstabber like you , richard .
how am i a back ?
i' m not the one talking , giving away all the information ... ... trying to get us caught because i' m a bitch !
don' t talk to me like that .
i' il talk to you how i want to .
i trust you with forensic stuff , and you have no idea what you' re talking about !
you' re supposed to be smart !
stop .
no , you' re not smart , you' re dumb !
stop !
i' m sorry .
come here .
that' s a good boy .
you' re not still mad about that girl , are you ?
let' s just stick together and stay calm until this is over , okay ?
and then what ?
and then what ?
justin ?
where are you going ?
we can' t be seen together .
do you think this is some kind of game ?
come on , come on .
this is sam kennedy .
i' m not here to take your call
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
do you want something ?
like what ?
i don' t know .
everybody wants something , don' t they ?
do they ?
they just don' t know how to ask for it .
what do you want ?
richard , get out of the way .
you think i' m too young ?
there was a killer at your school .
the whole time , somebody you were close to .
what do you mean ?
raymond feathers .
you guys were friends , right ?
with that degenerate ?
no .
he didn' t really have many friends .
he just ....
i don' t know .
you know , even his old lady left him .
so you' re friends with his old lady too ?
you' re a tease .
you lead guys on and then push them away .
but i think ... ... you like to fight .
you want it , but you need to fight about it .
no .
you don' t have to do anything .
you have no choice .
you can' t handle it , so you' re leaving ?
this is part of it !
damn it !
thank you , detective .
i bet you did this with every guy you ever dated .
tell me i' m wrong .
lf i can link richard to feathers  you can' t stop .
i' m sorry about what i said .
i' m just a little messed up right now , but hear me out , as a friend .
just as a friend , okay ?
thank you .
i saw richard and justin tonight .
they lied , they know each other .
really ?
they barely have parents .
they' re like orphans with credit cards .
school' s too easy .
they don' t have jobs or chores .
nothing' s expected of them .
nothing they do matters .
so they figured , " why not kill somebody ?
maybe i' m wrong , but tell rod you want to keep the case open .
what happened between you and richard tonight ?
did you hit him ?
in the face ?
no .
no , it wasn' t like that , it was
it was an acci
rod knows ?
he got a call from richard' s father .
he' il make you see the department shrink about this .
no .
no shrink .
it' s not gonna work .
i know what i am .
i' m just not
okay .
so nobody wants to work with me ?
that' s okay .
but i' m a good cop .
and if what i say is right , and we let these kids go , and they do it again ....
so please just talk to rod , you' re the only one he' il listen to .
i' il call him in the morning .
call him now , he' s still up .
back off !
if rod says yes ... ... maybe you could even hang around the school and make them nervous .
we have papers due tomorrow , no excuses .
support your conclusions , having a thesis isn' t enough .
i want real arguments with quotations and sources .
sam kennedy , san benito police .
nice to meet you .
lisa !
sam kennedy , from san benito police .
start time .
let' s see ....
it' s me .
i know how they did it .
now we need to know why .
i can help with that .
i got someone here you ought to talk to .
rod , look at the dna .
the vomit is a perfect match with justin .
who paid for this ?
cassie , out of her own pocket .
you' d need a jury of 12 forensic experts .
that' s why we need a confession from one of them .
they' il talk without an attorney ?
they want to prove they' re smarter than we are .
okay .
so where' s the other one ?
who ?
the hot one .
not here .
you get to work with her everyday ?
yeah .
i should become a cop .
so , what' s up with ray ?
i hear he' s like a serial killer or something .
well , actually , we have a theory on that .
it involves you and justin .
it' s just a theory .
can i lay it out for you ?
yeah .
therefore ... ... every truly free act is a crime , for crime sets one apart ... ... from the machinery of mass society .
it can' t be a crime of profit or passion , but gratuitous and random .
crime as philosophy , as freedom .
interesting .
do you believe it ?
it' s a school paper .
you have to write something .
i enjoy taking indefensible positions and creating an argument for them .
but do you believe it ?
so then the question is , how did you pick the victim ?
was it random ?
i mean , that' s the way i' d do it .
that one right there , with the flowers .
she' s perfect .
no , she' s too skinny .
you understand what random means ?
we don' t choose .
don' t talk to me like i' m a moron .
we have to follow the plan
this one !
what about this one ?
don' t get impatient .
wait a second .
pull up , where the girl is loading the groceries .
okay .
but you lose the point of a philosophical crime if you feel guilty .
how do you mean ?
if you kill somebody to prove you' re free , and then throw up
i didn' t .
what are you talking about ?
richard didn' t feel guilty .
he' s free , justin .
you' re not .
relax .
let them wonder what we' re up to .
now go in .
your coffee .
you can' t smoke in here .
come on .
are we almost done ?
take a seat .
so ray was an inspired choice .
but the great thing ... ... was how subtly you planted the fibers and hairs and stuff .
i got your product .
you did ray , right ?
wasn' t he your friend ?
you told him to hide in his trailer , didn' t you ?
what are you talking about ?
you went home , you said hello to your mother .
it took you 10 minutes to walk home from the restaurant .
mother , i' m home .
you said you had to do schoolwork so she wouldn' t look in .
and she didn' t .
she never did , did she ?
i was with six friends all night .
you know that .
you talked to them .
the night , sure , but not the day .
that' s the secret .
you weren' t there at night .
the thing that always confused me was the muddy footprints in the house .
you know ?
the planting bed was dry , so where did they come from ?
it was you at the house .
justin would not have walked through the wet beds .
that was exactly 3 : 30 .
how long did you wait for her to come home ?
you didn' t kill her there .
i gotta say , that was a stroke of genius .
did you think it up , or was it justin ?
i don' t know what you' re saying .
that helped us figure out the real timetable .
that gave you time to get home for the study group .
i' il go get some cash for the pizza .
you told them you were going to the atm to get cash .
and you did .
and i did .
then you hurried back .
that took five minutes .
it took five minutes .
now we' re talking .
but you were gone 15 .
what are you looking at ?
richard killed her .
didn' t he , justin ?
i think it was justin .
let me tell you something .
it' il be the most important thing you ever hear .
more important than the instructions on the sats and aps .
the person who actually killed olivia lake is gonna be executed .
or , at best , go to jail for life .
in your case that' d be about 60 years .
but the other one , who didn' t actually kill her , if he cooperates ... ... will have a chance at a real life .
richard was back in the study group by 9 : 25 .
so you must have dumped the body .
the planning was easy ... ... but now you had to actually do it .
and that' s why the postmortem wounds were so tentative .
you were trying to be like richard , but you couldn' t .
you weren' t that free .
thank god .
go to hell .
my guy won' t roll .
i figured he' d be the one .
no .
let' s talk about lisa .
she went out with richard ?
briefly .
then she got interested in justin .
let' s use that .
interesting theory , but i can' t admit to something i didn' t do .
looks like you won' t have to .
because justin is talking in there .
justin' s here ?
he told us about you .
about you and lisa .
which lisa ?
so you really need to tell me what happened .
just think of it as a game .
whoever talks first is the winner .
justin says you betrayed him .
he told us about lisa and the tape you made .
justin' s talking .
he' s gonna win this thing , unless you have something to tell me .
okay , i' m gonna go see .
wait , wait .
come on , sit down .
i have to advise you of certain rights .
the interview is over .
richard' s father' s lawyer .
charge them or let them go .
another five minutes , we would have had both those kids .
if i ever find out who leaked to the parents , i swear ....
no , that' s all right .
yeah , i' il talk to you tomorrow .
justin won' t talk , because he needs to prove he' s as tough as his buddy .
he' s tougher .
yeah , maybe .
that richard , i can' t wait till we nail him .
one of them is the doer , and he' s going down , but there' s something deeper
a narcissistic prick like richard doesn' t care about anyone but himself .
he uses justin to feed his ego .
push him around , make him feel like a man .
in five years , no one will care he was homecoming king ... ... or pole vaulting champ .
i pity anyone who gets in his way .
is richard a pole vaulter ?
i don' t know .
i was using it as an example of , you know ....
look ....
i know about carl hudson .
where did you get that ?
this is none of your god this is my matter !
mine !
i knew this girl in high school ... ... smart enough ... ... but she didn' t really come from anything .
and to everyone' s amazement , the most popular boy liked her .
state pole vaulting champ .
you' d watch him go over that bar in the sunlight ... ... that golden body , it was like ... ... life just couldn' t get any more beautiful than that .
and it didn' t .
she was 16 when she married him .
seventeen when he knocked out her upper bicuspid .
eighteen when she decided to leave .
he put her in the hospital with a serious concussion .
a week later , when she got out ... ... she started packing , and he was drunk .
he pointed his finger at her .
he said , " you try that again , i' il kill you .
he took another drink ... ... and she headed for the door .
why didn' t she wait till he was out ?
left for work ?
she couldn' t , she had to go right then .
why then ?
i don' t know .
it was because ....
because she ....
it wasn' t about getting away from him , it was about standing up to him .
even if it killed her .
i guess so .
so he stabbed her 17 times with a kitchen knife ... ... and dumped her body on a country road .
yeah , ruined my favorite dress .
carl hudson .
cutest boy i ever saw ... ... until richard haywood .
and you' re supposed to testify at carl' s parole hearing .
what are you gonna say ?
nothing .
i' m not going .
i' m not .
you gotta go up there , you have to .
no .
i don' t have to .
the girl was jessica marie hudson .
i have nothing to say about her .
you just inherited her scars .
look , i made a deal .
the deal was that she died there .
she' s in the ground , and i can go on with my life .
except you can' t .
all you think about is carl hudson .
he' s every case .
he' s every guy you date .
your whole world is carl hudson .
is that the life you' re going on with ?
did you ever get help for any of this ?
yeah .
i became a cop .
you can' t just pretend it didn' t happen .
it' s not that simple , cass .
it has to be .
because if it gets any more complicated , i can' t make it .
richard haywood is on line one .
swanson .
so you want to talk to me about this covington woman ?
yes , i know all about it .
what can i do for you ?
i just thought you' d want to know what really happened .
i thought it was a game .
how do you pick a victim ?
how do you get away with it ?
we were bored .
i never took it seriously until i walk in the room , and she' s laying there ....
did you make a deal with him ?
he says he wasn' t there  did you make a deal ?
i don' t make deals over the phone , but if it checks out ...
... and we can get a conviction , i will .
fine .
let' s get warrants now .
where are you going ?
you' re not supposed to leave without telling us .
will you be back for dinner ?
justin' s not here .
his mother doesn' t even know when he left .
similar story here .
what about goldilocks ?
get over there and see what she knows .
you should take a look downstairs .
i gotta go .
bye .
i didn' t know where else to go .
tell me what' s going on .
the cops are asking about you and richard .
i don' t know what to say .
we killed a woman .
no , you didn' t .
yes , we did .
he made you do it .
it wasn' t just richard .
but he drove it .
it was his idea .
you would have never done anything like this by yourself .
he seduced you ... ... just like he seduced me .
you know what you have to do .
you have to tell them everything .
i will .
i don' t have any feelings left .
except for you .
that' s him .
don' t answer it .
where are you ?
are you with her ?
no .
yes , you are .
and you told her about us , didn' t you ?
did you tell her everything ?
where are you ?
i left home .
all right ?
i' m gone .
i' m never going back .
it' s over .
i know .
we have to turn ourselves in .
and go to prison ?
and be punks ?
and eat shit for the rest of our lives ? !
do you remember what we talked about ?
yes .
meet me at the bluff in an hour .
okay ?
okay .
i have to meet him .
to do what ?
i just have to .
i wish i met you first .
cassie mayweather .
have a seat .
so this is what we talked about .
glory or nothing .
should we say the words for the last time ?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that while some live ... ... others die .
on three .
one .
two .
three .
what are you doing ?
i have the bullets , right ?
what about you ?
open your chamber .
open it !
you were gonna watch me kill myself ?
they' re here at the old wintu lodge .
roger .
that' s up off highland road ?
so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them ... ... l' il shoot you , and then i' il shoot myself , okay ?
no .
no ?
why ?
would you rather go to prison and be a punk ?
or do you think you' il beat prison ?
because you made a deal .
you talked .
you talked !
why don' t you shoot me ?
shoot me in the head , in the heart .
whatever you want .
do it .
doesn' t matter anymore .
pull the fucking trigger .
pull it !
come on !
justin , don' t .
we have to pay for what we did .
not like that .
put the gun down .
put it down .
please don' t .
justin , listen to me .
for me .
come over here , next to me .
don' t listen to her .
don' t !
hands off !
stay put .
people are on the way .
hey , richard ?
you think you' re so smart , huh ?
justin' s smarter than you , remember that .
i got one left .
to hell with it .
every night , the same fucking thing ?
listen !
listen to me !
you are not going out that door , jess !
you are not going out that door !
justin , please !
justin , please .
don' t !
justin !
justin , don' t !
no , no !
don' t !
grab it .
i got it .
thank you , thank you .
i' m okay , thank you .
what' s gonna happen to me ?
since you weren' t the actual killer , and what you did down there for me ....
don' t worry about it , i' il take care of you .
you all right ?
whisper something into my ear .
what ?
just anything .
remember what i said about looking for new partners ?
are you serious ?
where was it ?
i want to take that back .
did they find the videotape ?
yes .
how' s he doing ?
he looks okay .
but we' re gonna transport him for treatment .
why did you let richard videotape the killing ?
that was really stupid , like you guys wanted to get caught .
what are you talking about ?
oh , you don' t know ?
they found a hidden camera in richard' s basement .
that' s how he filmed himself with lisa .
he filmed the killing too .
the d. a. is looking at it now .
look , whatever is on that tape ....
whatever' s on that tape what ?
is there really a tape ?
maybe i should talk to a lawyer .
absolutely .
no , wait a second .
wait !
i thought richard manipulated you , but it was the other way around .
these marks are from richard' s ring when he tried to strangle me .
there are none of these marks on olivia' s neck .
richard could have taken off that ring to make it look like ray did it .
the ring has nothing to do with it .
tell me what happened ... ... and i' il do my best to get you tried as a juvenile .
you have to believe me .
when i went over there , i had no idea .
i never thought i' d ....
oh , god .
are you gonna do it or what ?
i can' t .
fuck !
so , what , i have to do it ?
you don' t do anything .
you just have ideas .
and you' re so full of shit too .
crime is not an idea , it' s an act .
anybody can think it .
only free men can do it .
i' m free .
give me the gloves .
give them to me .
thank you .
i had to show him .
i could have let you die up there , but i didn' t .
thank you .
wait !
i just want a chance .
i wanna start over .
i wanna
it doesn' t work that way .
you get one life .
and whatever you do with it , whatever' s done to you ... ... you gotta face that .
you can' t pretend it didn' t happen .
jessica marie hudson ?
jessica marie hudson .
for the carl hudson parole hearing ?
jessica marie hudson ?
that' s me .
