and not without authorization .
captain , i don' t have time for this .
do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me ?
look .
i don' t want to talk about it .
the fact of the matter is , it was worth the lives of you and your men .
you and your men ?
she thinks you are a man .
i think she' s an idiot .
i know you are not a man .
i think you' re an idiot too .
very funny .
but i do want to talk about it .
did it occur to you that maybe we are not volunteer to risk our lives ?
have we been given a choice ?
nobody asked you to save me .
i can' t believe this .
you have not changed a bit .
gray ?
yeah , nice to see you too .
welcome back , captain .
we' re cleaned .
let' s make sure of this , shall we ?
i hate getting scanned .
sir , the scan probably worth to us than the phantoms .
i' il probably abort it , captain .
this machine are suspected to causing sterility .
and i want to have a little new junior to call me daddy someday .
that' s a spooky thought .
why are you always busting my chop ?
people , let' s just do this thing .
alright .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
okay , next .
looks like you gain some weight .
it' s called body strength , neil .

i' m working on it .
you know my security rating allows me to bypass this .
not today , it doesn' t .
something' s not right .
about this mission ?
or that woman ?
both .
next .
listen , captain .
i think ...
i don' t care what you think , doctor .
you' re getting scanned just like everybody else .
oh shit !
captain !
they got him .
there must be a mistake .
you came in contact with the phantom , sir .
please remain calm .
administering treatment shield .
what level is he ?
blue .
he will be coded at 3 1/ 2 minutes .
we have to treat him now .
i' m sorry .
that' s impossible .
we' il transfer him to the treatment center .
there' s no time for that .
take him to the table .
hang on , captain .
locating particles .
jesus !
look at that thing .
how much more time ?
not enough .
when he reaches code red , the treatment shield won' t be able to hold the aliens particles
engaging bio ethereal laser .
what' s going on ?
where does it go ?
what the hell is going on ?
we lost contact .
infer station is moving deeper .
dragging .
there is no time .
dragging .
there is no time !
you' re gonna lose him .
founded .
it' s alright .
don' t worry .
you' il be back to normal in no time .
doctor , we need to scan you for in infer station .
that won' t be necessary .
i' il take responsibility .
hey , doc .
thanks for saving him .
are you alright ?
yeah , but the military has impounded my ship
what' s with her ?
and what' s with her with the captain ?
what' s with her and the stupid plan ?
what ?
forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far .
yes , doctor .
spirits ?
i thought we are not suppose to use the s word .
don' t get smart with me .
let' s see if the plant does the trick .
it' s a match .
we' ve found it .
yes , the 6th spirit .
a little scene today brought me every protocol
how long do you think this would have survive outside the barrier ?
aki , you know there are elements in the council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down .
look .
1 0 years ago , who discovered the energy and the phantoms ?
you .
and who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form ?
you .
you made the possible to harness that energy for overpacks , scanners , even the barrier .
the council knows that .
they trust you , doctor .
we are so close to proving ...
we still need this part and this one here .
exactly .
two more pieces and we solve the puzzle .
we need to be free to find these pieces .
i want to show you something , aki .
what is this ?
read .
all life is born of gaya and each life has a spirit .
each new spirit is housed in physical body .
doctor ...
go on .
through their experiences on earth , the spirits mature and grows .
when the physical body dies , the mature spirit enrich by it' s life on earth returns to gaya .
bring in with it the experiences , enabling gaya to live and grow .
to my old diary .
i wrote that 43 years ago when i was the age you are now .
dr. sid !
i don' t know what happen to gary will .
they threw him into jail because he said that earth was not descendant of the universe .
that could happen to us .
our ideas are unpopular , aki .
if you have any notes or records , it could be used against you .
destroy them .
keep them up here .
right .
and stay away from your friend , that captain .
he saves your life , you save his life .
that' s least to that .
i was once young too , you know .
doctor , there is a war going on .
no one is young anymore .
could you please explain why zeus cannon was completed a month ago .
if we attack their media with this , we will eliminate the phantoms at their source .
general hein , calm down .
at our last meeting , we voted 6 to 2 to postpone using the zeus cannon .
to attack alienated media .
we have reconvince today to vote on that very issue again .
now i would like to ask the director of the bio ethereal center to speak .
dr sid , please .
as you all know , the phantom nested the alienated media that landed here 34 years ago .
what you see now , are the records of assault on the media to date .
physical attacks here had no affect .
this seems to place 3 months ago joining a full scale of art .
please note that the phantom outside the media are indeed destroyed .
however inside , many that come to live .
and as you see over all phantom density remains the same .
the newly recent aliens response to the attack .
by burly , even deeper into the earth .
now this is very interesting to me , dr. sid .
because we see the same thing during surgery .
when using bio ethereal laser on phantom particles .
do we not ?
yes , indeed we do .
you see the injured escape , burying or digging themselves deeper into the patient body .
when we increase the laser power to destroy these deep particles .
we have had incidents resulting and further injury to a patient .
and in some cases , death .
and what exactly does that mean , doctor ?
it means there is a very good chance to being from the zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media .
exactly .
thank you .
however , it also means that the being energy maybe too strong injuring the earth .
injure the earth ?
you mean the spirit of the earth ?
yes .
the spirit of the earth .
i need to say what i need to say .
i know what i' m doing .
and whatever you do , keep you mouth shut .
this is ridiculous .
doctor , with all the respect .
you come here just to talk about some gaya theory ?
tell us the planet is alive ?
has a spirit ?
that' s a fairy tale , doctor .
sorry , but we don' t have time for that .
it' s not a fairy tale , it' s true .
so if i point a gun to the earth and fire ,
i' m not just making a hole on the ground , i am killing the planet .
dr. sid , the gaya theory has not been proven .
even the gaya does exist .
we still have to remove the phantoms .
i think if there is any chance of success .
we should take it ?
don' t you agree ?
of course i do .
but there is an alternative to this space cannon
another method ?
yes , i mean of disabling the phantoms .
please .
we know that the aliens display distinct energy pattern
now it is a fact that two bio ethereal waves places one over the other will cancel each other out .
it' s the erectile possible to construct the wave pattern direct opposition to the phantom energy .
we are currently assembling ...
dr. sid ....
such a wave in new completion ...
members of the council , gathering plants and animals from around the world to fight the phantoms is other nonsense .
the zeus cannon is a proven effective weapon .
it will kill phantoms .
can we afford to wait for some crazy inventions
some army of touchy feeling plants and animals
an invention with no solid evidence that will destroy the aliens .
there is evidence .
our partially completed energy wave has a terminally successfully stopped phantom particles from spreading through a terminally infected patient .
doctor , do you claim to have evidence that terminally patient has been cured .
not cured .
the wave is not completed .
but we have succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient .
where is the proof ?
here .
you may have bothered sometime , aki .
but i wonder what caused ?
doctor , i can' t keep hiding in the background while you protect me .
i want what life i have left to mean something .
you listen to me .
when we find the 7th and 8th spirits ......
if we find them , what we need now is some luck .
luck has nothing to do with it .
fate and hard work , girl .
cause i' il be damn if you die before me .
the council decided to postpone firing the zeus cannon .
i guess i put on a good show .
mind if i take a look ?
you' il probably get bored .
so what are you doing ?
oh , i see .
giving me the silent treatment .
i am scanning the city for the 7th spirit .
hurry up , neil .
i almost got it .
what do you think you are doing ?
we just gonna strengthen them for a while .
hey , don' t look at me .
it was his idea .
it' s your idea ?
we just help the captain up a little .
come on , jane .
where' s your sense of romance ?
you see how the captain looks at her .
it' s a more , baby .
what' s going on ?
probably just a glint .
listen , aki ...
i' m still mad at you .
you are mad at me ?
leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were ?
that doesn' t seem a little childish .
i was just a little upset when you dispatched and leave the zeus station without saying a word .
now you know what' s going on , alright ?
now i know .
my operation had to be done in zero graph , okay ?
fine ! how about the fact that i was sent there on the job
and you won' t even see me ?
i was probably helping dr. sid collected the spirit wave .
now i know .
so i' m sorry .
well , me too .
so we are both sorry .
so would you tell me about them ?
about what ?
about the spirits you collected .
i was infected by the phantom during an experiment .
normally no one could had survived .
how could you ?
dr. sid created a memory around the infection
keeping me alive .
so the first spirit wave was me .
the second was a fish .
a fish ?
the third was a deer i found in a wildlife preserved outside moscow .
the fourth was a bird .
ever try to track a sparrow out of space ?
it' s no fun .
what am i saying ?
you probably would love that .
you are right .
i probably would .
and then there was that plant i collected from time square .
i thought that was number 6 .
what ?
you skipped one .
the fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room .
i retrieved the disabling time , but she ...
i told her everything has a spirit .
dogs , cats , trees , little girls , even the earth .
i told her that she wasn' t dying , just returning to the earth spirit .
the gaya .
she ... told me that she was ready to die .
she said i didn' t have to make up stories to make her feel better .
only 7 years old and ready to die .
i' m sorry .
i have work to do .
i have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits .
don' t ... please ....
you don' t believe any of this , do you ?
i just ... don' t know , aki .
is this why you shut me out ?
you should have told me .
i don' t know how much time i left .
who does ?
i better get back to scanning .
captain edwards , you extracted a dr. ross from old new york several days ago .
did you not ?
what were you impressions of dr ross ?
she seems very capable and determines .
you and the deep eyes are being temporary reassigned .
you will guard dr. ross when she re enters the waste land .
understood , sir .
you don' t understand yet , captain .
report any ebullient behavior in dr ross to the major immediately .
ebullient behavior , sir ?
the woman carries an alien infer station , captain .
we don' t know what it maybe doing to her .
the aliens presence could be effecting her judgement .
and maybe manipulate the doctor for their very own purposes
is the general suggesting that dr ross is a spy ?
the general is wondering why he explains himself to a captain .
she separated long exposure to phantom tissue
if this begins to manifest itself in anyway ,
dr ross is to be placed under arrest .
and transport here for observation .
it is in fact for her own good , captain .
of course , sir .
major , send some of our man to keep an eye on our good captain .
i' m convinced these dreams are some form of communication .
the message still elude to me .
but they are coming faster now .
and that can only mean one thing .
the phantoms inside me are beginning to win
our target is to discrete at two sign .
roger .
phantom concentration .
not good .
we got big minutes everywhere .
so it' s gonna be a real picnic .
stick close to me .
no heroin today , okay ?
everything by the book .
by the book , alright .
if we drop energy here , here and here .
we should be able quiet at the target and get out even before the phantoms know we were there .
and that would attract the phantoms .
for a while .
so you are from the 307s , right ?
under general hein ?
have you done any wasteland recon before ?
and get pretty ugly .
captain , rendezvous at sector 6 coded 279 .
roger that .
stellar for hard files .
looks like they are taking a bath .
the 7th spirit should be just beyond the line .
i don' t see how any living thing could survive out here .
you' il find out soon enough .
this was the phantom cleansing mission .
it was supposed the end of war .
my father is in here somewhere .
alright .
let' s move out , people .
i' il be damn .
a survivor .
what is it doing out here ?
hoping for life to return .
is that our spirit , doc ?
no .
we' ve closing in on a life form .
distance ?
hard to say .
we are very close .
i don' t see anything .
you' re not gonna tell me it' s him .
that' s impossible
it' s not the soldier .
it' s his overpack .
how do you explain that ?
packs ?
power or weapon ?
the barrier cities ?
i mean it' s just by with theory energy .
and to create that energy , we use living tissue .
single cell organism .
you' re telling me his backpack is the 7th spirit .
yes .
captain , do you read me ?
once again .
captain , we have incoming .
ryan , get the soldier' s pack .
i need a hand , sergeant .
those boys .
yeah .
then i' il working .
thank you .
are you alright ?
of course i am .
let' s get the hell out of here .
something is not right .
it should be happening .
something are tracking them .
aki ...
there are right on us , sir .
closing fast .
jane , take the lead .
fire the hole !
get us out of here , neil .
sir , i would love to .
but ...
just do it !
sir ?
locate that seat .
that doesn' t look good , captain .
we have to get her to a hospital .
you have your order , sir .
what the hell is happening here ?
dr ross is to be taken into the custody now .
lower your weapon .
that' s an order .
we have no choice but to relief you and your command .
i won' t let you do this , soldier .
you' il gonna have to shoot me .
bend down , captain !
aki !
hang on , everyone !
that' s enough !
everyone down .
neil , get us back to new york .
fast .
the device are returned from the wasteland , sir .
apparently there was an incident .
it would seem the phantoms were attracted to dr ross .
the crew barely escaped with their lives .
and sir ...
captain edward is still in command .
issue an order .
i want edward and dr ross to be place under arrest .
all research materials pretending to dr sid wave theory are to be confiscated immediately .
that might not go over too well with the council , sir .
what a tragedy that would be .
this is perfect , major .
it' s too good the captain has opened the door for us .
by tomorrow morning , the council would bear our feet .
thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us .
to save them from the phantoms .
how is she , doctor ?
she is dying .
there must be something you can do .
aki is fighting with only the 6th and 8th spirits .
we have to implant the 7th directly into her chest plate .
it took a bullet .
i think it might be damage .
we have to appear this panel quickly .
her vital signs are dropping .
aki is slipping away from us .
she needs a sympathetic spirit to help her held hold in this world .
and i can think of no spirit but to suit for that task but yours , captain .
i don' t understand .
you don' t have to understand .
you just be with her now .
you' il keep her here with us .
aki , where are we ?
on an alien planet .
how is that possible ?
i' m not entirely sure .
you seem pretty calm .
i have been having this dream every night for months .
dream ?
well , whatever it is .
you' re really here , aren' t you ?
what' s happening to me ?
dr sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body .
then you are my spiritual support .
gray , how sweet of you .
i don' t think you realize how serious this situation is .
something you should see here , sir .
and i am watching ... what , major ?
it seems dr ross has been recording her dreams .
and why would i be interested in it ... her dreams ?
this is it .
this is our evidence .
she' s under influence of the phantoms .
dr ross' s dreams should be all the council needs authorize the firing of the zeus cannon .
the council is contempt to hide powering inside this barrier while the world dies a little more everyday .
i believe they need a push in the right direction , major .
get another a group of your most trusted men .
what are they doing ?
why are they staring at us ?
not at us .
welcome back , captain .
is it over ?
how is she , doctor ?
she is going to be fine .
but this is only temporary .
we need to find the 8th and final spirit to cure her .
aki , can you hear me ?
i' d finished it .
i know what the phantoms really are .
nobody move !
you are all under arrest !
we have them , sir .
sir ?
my wife and daughter .
were killed by phantoms in san francisco when the city was attacked .
did i ever tell you that ?
i try to imagine what ...
how is that like seeing everyone around you , fall over dead with no apparent reason .
and then at the end , you' re feeling something next to you .
invisible ... touching you .
reaching inside your body .
you' ve lost family , haven' t you ?
yes , sir .
that' s why i trust you .
all for you .
you know what must be done .
major , arrest these man .
reduce power to sector 31 .
sir , you do realize that the phantoms ...
what i realize , major is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy .
25 % % of energy redirect .
over ring power put to sector 31 .
bury the bridge in sector 31 , general .
they' re coming through now .
i think we can easily handle a few phantoms in a contain space .
relax , major .
when this night is over , you are going to be a hero .
aki , i don' t think ...
you were in my dream , gray .
you saw it .
that' s just it .
i' m not sure what i saw .
how can you be ?
captain , please .
let her continue .
why do you think , we' ve never been able to determine a relationship between the human size phantoms .
and the giant one' s roaming away slants .
excuse me , doc .
but frequent relationship .
i mean you got your human size phantoms and your creepy caterpillary phantoms .
and your flying phantoms .
and let' s not forget my personal favorite .
the big fat giant phantoms ...
down , boy .
he' s right .
if you spend as much time in this field as we have .
you know there is no relationship .
is like a zoo out there .
precisely , i think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride ?
it must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark .
we always assume that the media was intended as a form of transportation .
perhaps it wasn' t .
the media is a chunk of their planet .
they got thrown into space when they destroyed their world .
but how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock ?
they didn' t .
this is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense .
what do you think about all this , captain ?
i think that explains why we never had a chance .
all our strategies are based on one assumption .
that me are fighting alien invaders .
think of the dream , gray .
how they die ?
since then , all they know is suffering .
they are not an invading army .
they are ghosts .
how many phantoms ?
more than enough to convince the council , sir .
excellent .
send the squad out to eliminate them .
yes , sir .
sir , i have numerous phantoms contacts .
well , of course you do .
outside sector 31 , sir .
and moving in incredible speed .
major , what the hell is going on here ?
they are in the pipes .
that' s impossible .
no living thing could survive in those pipes .
well , we got a big one heading this way .
oh my god ...
hold your fire !
what have i done ?
come on , neil .
we need to find a way out .
now think .
captain , these wall titanium alloy .
and the bars are all pole sonic lasers .
i mean is not like i can just wave a magic wont and ...
neil , i' m impressed .
that makes two of us .
proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
i think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
here they come .
but the others ...
dr. sid !
deep eyes will take care of him .
come on !
what' s happening ?
why can we see them now ?
it must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier .
behind you !
on the board , captain .
we must find my ship .
if it was towed inside the city , it could be in the military hangar .
that' s a big ' if ' .
look out !
get us out of the platform .
you got it .
okay , now what ?
we' re going through the station .
what ?
captain , with all respect ...
excuse me , captain ...
we' re going through it .
it' s the only way .
should i gather all this will be somehow a rough ride .
doc , you got a talent for understatement .
hang on , everybody .
doc ?
interesting .
anybody hurt ?
captain !
oh god !
talk to me , sergeant .
give me a hand , jane .
no , wait !
we' re risking for the injury .
we need the proper tools to cut him out .
they are in my ship .
no !
no , doc .
no drugs .
captain ...
you heard the man .
we' il find the ship and we' il be back for you .
i' il stay with him .
me too .
nobody' s staying .
just give me a gun .
you got it .
give him a weapon .
do it !
we' il be back for you , sergeant .
you hear me ?
i hear you , captain .
now get out of here .
let' s move out .
aqua isolated t. v.
this is good .
it can be used to retrieve ryan and transport him safely here .
however we need to replace this plane' s fuel
there could be some lives overpack in the hangar .
alright , jane .
check the hangar .
neil , get us ready for take off .
aki and dr. sid prep the quad troll .
i' il go to the tower and rotate the air track .
the city maybe lose .
but we are not .
let' s do this thing and get the hell out of here .
gray ...
be careful .
you too .
oh yeah .
neil , do you read me ?
loud and clear , captain .
this baby would fly itself .
flight plane is set .
beginning rotation .
this is not the air track .
we have a problem .
i' m reading an impound tracks detach to the ship .
can you disengage it from the cockpit ?
no , sir .
permission to go outside and detach the cockpit .
do it !
there is the problem .
the controls are locked naturally .
jane , let me ask you something .
you think we' re going to get out here alive ?
i mean i' m wondering if anybody is getting out
you think anyone had made it this far ?
you think this 8th spirit stuff is going to work and chase out all the phantoms ?
i mean what if it is all a bunch of mambo jumbo ?
jane , do you mind if we stop talking ?
i gotta concentrate here .
what' s happening down there .
nothing we can' t handle .
what' s your status ?
almost there .
we' re fine , sir .
jane is negotiating with the extreme residents .
talk to me , jane .
no problem here , captain .
yes !
captain , we are good to go .
no !
jane , get out of there .
get out now !
go !
get the hell out of there !
jane !
unseal the power and ready .
where are you going ?
to the cockpit .
the ship is set on autopilot
we are in countdown to leave off .
wait .
it' s too dangerous .
aki !
over here .
you son of the bitch .
ryan !
gray , do you read me ?
what' s happening ?
you and sid are getting out of here now .
no !
we can' t just leave everyone .
everyone' s dead .
i' m sorry .
but you don' t have a choice .
goodbye , aki .
i just ...
i wish i could believe they are in a better place .
i enlarge the scanning parameter to include an area .
the impact crater .
that' s the strange place to find the ex spirit .
yes , really .
but nothing can survive there except phantoms .
precisely .
we suggest that the 8th spirit is a phantom spirit .
i can' t explain it until that moment .
but once we get down there ...
wait !
you' il understand ...
wait .
that' s the one way trip .
yes .
yes , i expected that' s how you' il valuate our chance .
what am i wrong ?
no , i agree .
we' il probably won' t live long enough
to extract the 8th spirit from the crater ...
then why should we try it ?
because we don' t need to extract the 8th spirit .
we can bring the final spirit here .
we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater .
yes .
exactly .
and how do we do that ... exactly ?
i can construct the device .
that would attach to aki' s chest plate together the eight spirits and then ...
and then what ?
and then we wait .
and see what happens .
that' s it ?
that' s your plan ?
we wait and see what happens ?
yes .
oh good .
but i got my own plan .
we keep scanning the surface of orbit .
maybe we' il find the compatible spirit somewhere else .
aki ?
i say we go in .
general hein , you' re clear to go in to the zero one alpha .
what caused the battle failed , general hein ?
i' m afraid it' s only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers .
but i' m ready to see you and the rest of the council to evacuate to houston without incident .
it was a terrible suffer this evening .
the council had reconsidered your proposal fire the zeus cannon .
i see .
we are transmitting the access code to you now .
and general , best of luck to us all .
prepare to fire the cannon .
target , sir ?
the phantom crater .
prepare to drop in three , two , one .
powering the shield .
okay , we are over the mini one .
do you have it inside , doctor .
there are so many of them ?
wait .
yes .
i' m tracking the 8th spirit moving along the crater surface .
alright .
now let' s take a closer look .
ready to fire in 3 minutes .
overpack set maximum .
transferring class to other .
counter thrusters are engaged .
locks flow the couple .
status is green .
we have something in the radar over the impact side , sir .
it' s her .
sir .
just a traitor on the influence of the enemy .
continue the countdown .
we' il take them all out at the same time .
we' re closing on the phantom .
contact in 30 seconds .
target locked .
ready to fire on your command .
it' s a match .
it' s a perfect match .
target' s cannon is ready , sir .
fire !
what was that ?
it' s the zeus .
they' re firing on the crater .
aki , gray , are you alright ?
a little shaking .
stand by .
sid , the 8th spirit is not on our scanner .
do you have it ?
the 8th has been destroyed .
what are we going to do now ?
nothing .
this mission is over .
we have to get out of here .
incoming !
what is that ?
if you gonna get us out of here , you better do it now .
hold on !
i can' t hold on to you .
i' m not able to maintain .
emergency landing procedures .
come in , come in , please
aki , gray , can you hear me ?
sid , i need to talk to the station .
can you pass us through ?
what is that thing ?
i don' t know , sir .
incoming message , sir .
general hein , you must cease fire immediately .
what are you looking at , in the crater is the living spirit of an alien' s home world .
the planet was destroyed and part of the it landed here .
this is not an invasion .
it never was .
oh , i see .
and what we have been fighting all this time , doctor ?
ghosts ?
yes , spirits that are confused , lost and angry .
oh right ?
and these spirits are coming out of the gaya ,
earth gaya .
doctor , even if i believe in such nonsense .
the fact remains the earth is under attack from aggressor who must be destroyed at all cost .
the cost maybe the entire planet , sir .
fire on the alien gaya would only make it stronger .
since that you under the alien influence , doctor .
i will take your protest to mean , we are in fact persuading the correct course of action .
i suggest you take your last few months and prepare to meet your gaya .
continue to fire until the invaders have been destroyed .
general , this is the mis over hitting .
we are going to hit again and again .
and keep on hitting it , until it' s dead .
but sir , we not even sure if it has any affect on the other creature .
no affect .
we got them in the run , soldier .
this is the moment of our victory . order you to fire .
this won' t allow us to fire again .
we' il see about that .
now shield is out , we' re seeking doc in here .
come on .
this is not a good place to be .
what the hell is that ?
that' s something i' m thinking , is it ?
yes !
it' s gaya .
definitely not a good place to be .
are you alright ?
i' m fine .
i have to talk to dr. sid .
sid , do you read me ?
go ahead .
i' m still here .
we are looking at gaya .
you hear me , sir ?
gaya !
i think this explains why the ex spirits appeared here .
yes .
yes , that' s it .
a phantom must have changed into the 8th spirit when it starts a new life born on our own gaya .
if so , it would have been given a different energy signature that set apart from the other phantoms .
you two could not have hope for better location to find a new compatible spirit .
whatever you do , don' t move .
stay right where you are .
staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sound .
don' t shoot any of them .
you could destroy our last hope .
and what do you suggest i do , doctor ?
ask them to play nice ?
combat strategy is your area of expertise , not mine .
i have a reading here in official .
do you see it ?
yes , a compatible spirit .
it must be very near you .
where ?
which one is it ?
which one ?
i' m having difficulty now .
just a moment .
doctor , it' s getting crowded in here .
we don' t have much time .
aki ... aki !
with the hope of new life , has gaya changed the phantom within ?
i have it .
gray , get in here .
i need you .
do you hear me , sid ?
the wave pattern is completed .
yes , i read you .
this is wonderful .
i don' t see how you could have found the final spirit .
it found me , doctor .
i see now .
i understand .
i don' t understand .
what the hell is going on ?
give me your overpack .
i need to project it in the complete way .
we' il be defenseless .
i hope you know what you are doing , aki .
we can use the shield to project the wave .
dr sid' s theory was right .
i have it , the 8th spirit .
i' m cured , gray .
are you sure you have the final spirit ?
yes , yes .
i' m sure .
but how ?
how can you know that ?
don' t worry , the phantom told me .
oh , great .
that' s it .
shield on .
it' s not working .
we have to do something before it' s too late .
if this doesn' t work , then it' s already too late .
gray ... trust me .
no !
no !
get down !
warning system overload .
i know .
warning system overload .
i know !
but it must be done .
fire !
fire !
damn it !
fire !
gray ?
gray !
don' t leave me , gray .
i told you this was an one way trip .
looks like i was right .
no , gray .
hang on , please .
i still have the wave .
we can get through this .
we are going to make it .
we are going to make it .
we both know that isn' t time .
gray ...
help me .
gray ...
listen to me .
you saved my life once .
now i want you to save yourself .
gray , no .
please .
let me do this , aki .
trust me .
don' t leave me , gray .
you have been trying to tell me death isn' t the end .
don' t back out on me .
now i finally believe .
i love you .
oh , it' s warm .
