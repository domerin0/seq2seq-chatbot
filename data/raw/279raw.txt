ftp 1984 sentinels .
damn it .
we were headed for junction 21 like you ordered .
robbie picked up the signals we' re confirming the hr scans .
we weren' t sure what to do .
the readings don' t make any sense .
they read like sentinels .
but there' s thousands of them .
directly above us .
ls that possible ?
we got company .
they don' t look happy to see us .
get us out of here .
we' re cut off !
there' s an intersection .
it' s uncharted .
take it !
get to the gun turrets !
right .
come get some .
hang on .
i' ve never seen the surface .
it' s nothing now but one big graveyard .
oh , my god .
it' s an army .
what is that thing ?
some kind of tunneling machine .
oh , no .
what ?
look where we are .
what' s four kilometers straight down ?
zion .
go .
go .
go !
zion .
zion has to be warned !
how ?
someone had to get to a drop point .
what ?
are you crazy ?
we can' t broadcast now !
we have to .
i' il go .
there isn' t much time .
i' il make it .

no , you never do .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thadeus .
welcome to the zion archive .
you have selected historical file number 1 2 1 .
the second renaissance .
in the beginning , there was man .
and for a time , it was good .
but humanity' s so called civil societies ... ... soon fell victim to vanity and corruption .
he says , " i' m sorry , sir , i' m incapable of that function .
then man made the machine in his own likeness .
whoops !
pardon me .
coming through .
thus did man become the architect of his own demise .
but for a time , it was good .
the machines worked tirelessly to do man' s bidding .
it was not long before seeds of dissent took root .
though loyal and pure , the machines earned no respect from their masters ... ... these strange , endlessly multiplying mammals . hearing the prosecution' s closing statement ... ... in what' s expected to be the final day of the b 1 66er trial .
b 1 66er .
a name that will never be forgotten .
for he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters . which that instrument provides for and secures ... ... to the citizens of the united states .
on the contrary , they were , at that time ... ... considered as a subordinate and inferior class
at b 1 66er' s murder trial ... ... the prosecution argued for an owner' s right to destroy property .
b 1 66er testified that he simply did not want to die .
rational voices dissented .
who was to say the machine , endowed with the very spirit of man ... ... did not deserve a fair hearing ?
the leaders of men were quick to order the extermination of b 1 66er ... ... and every one of his kind throughout each province of the earth .
androids and liberal sympathizers flooded the streets of the nation' s capital today . threat of violence to make good on the legacy of b 1 66er .
fifteen thousand mechanicals and human sympathizers ... ... have continued their demonstration in front of the albany courthouse ... ... in what has been dubbed the " million machine march .
the demonstrators have been met with squads of defense forces in riot gear .
robot bitch !
i got something for you !
hold her up !
no , please !
that' s all , paint job !
i' m real !
die , bots , die !
banished from humanity , the machines sought refuge in their own promised land .
they settled in the cradle of human civilization ... ... and thus a new nation was born .
a place the machines could call home .
a place they could raise their descendants .
and they christened the nation zero one .
zero one prospered .
and for a time , it was good .
the machines ' artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man' s society ... ... including , eventually , the creation of new and better al .
if you need the flexibility of a helipod with the speed of an air jet ... ... look no further !
our patented vector thrust coil gives the zero one versatran ... ... the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a multiengine failure .
versatran .
it' s the only choice .
the human nations ' credit rating is falling like a stone ... ... while zero one' s currency is climbing without stopping for breath .
with headlines like that , the markets have no choice
but the leaders of men , their power waning ... ... refused to cooperate with the fledgling nation ... ... wishing rather that the world be divided .
the world community of nations cannot tolerate this kind of flagrant deception
today approved initiatives for both economic sanctions ... ... and a naval blockade as a means of containment and isolation of zero one .
zero one' s ambassadors pleaded to be heard .
at the united nations , they presented plans for a stable , civil relationship ... ... with the nations of man .
zero one' s admission to the united nations was denied .
but it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there .
and man said , " let there be light .
and he was blessed by light , heat , magnetism , gravity ... ... and all the energies of the universe .
the prolonged barrage engulfed zero one in the glow of a thousand suns .
but unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh ... ... the machines had little to fear of the bombs ' radiation and heat .
thus did zero one' s troops advance outwards in every direction .
and one after another , mankind surrendered its territories .
so the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet .
the destruction of the sky .
lt. gaeda , please report to the op center .
all right , you maggots !
at 0800 , prepare to move out !
george company , prepare to move out .
charlie company , prepare to move out .
our father who art in heaven , we thank you for your ....
put on your spiritual armor to stand against the wiles of the devil .
hotel bravo , this is papa one .
operation dark storm initiated .
thus would man try to cut the machines off from the sun ... ... their main energy source .
may there be mercy on man and machine for their sins .
go !
go !
kill them !
kill them all !
kill them all !
kill them all !
fire in the hole !
come on , get back out there .
give us some more artillery .
9 o' clock , near mike johnson' s
hold on , i' m coming to get you !
keep firing , keep firing !
help me !
help me !
no !
help me !
my god , help me !
the machines , having long studied men' s simple , protein based bodies ... ... dispensed great misery upon the human race .
victorious , the machines now turned to the vanquished .
the bioelectric , thermal and kinetic energies of the human body .
a newly fashioned symbiotic relationship between the two adversaries was born .
the machine drawing power from the human body ... ... an endlessly multiplying , infinitely renewable energy source .
this is the very essence of the second renaissance .
bless all forms of intelligence .
your flesh is a relic , a mere vessel .
hand over your flesh , and a new world awaits you .
we demand it .
it' s getting late , sweetie .
come inside .
your favorite simulation .
just killing time .
you want to spar ?
as you wish .
that was too easy .
what' s the problem ?
where' s your concentration ?
maybe you regret taking the red pill .
maybe .
it crosses everyone' s mind at least once .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
a carefree life in the country .
the life we had before knowing all this .
even if that life was just an illusion ?
it' s ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world .
finally starting to warm up .
listen to me .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
it' s all right .
i' ve blocked the signal so no one else can hear us .
so , what ?
you gonna propose ?
i' m going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me .
come on , be serious , duo .
stop teasing me .
i am serious , and you know it .
i really thought you' d be with me on this .
anyway , it' s done and it' s all been settled with them .
what do you mean , it' s all been settled ?
this is the only way .
it' s just a matter of time before zion is wiped out .
come with me .
stop it .
please do not do this to me , duo .
we can' t .
we can !
i' ve come to my senses .
you should do the same .
i took the red pill because i wanted to know the truth .
but i don' t care about the truth anymore .
what' s real doesn' t matter .
what' s important is how we live our lives .
are you listening to me ?
you know i' m right .
but we can' t go back , duo .
we know the truth now .
we can forget all of this .
duo ....
i know how .
trust me .
don' t be afraid to look into your heart .
say what you' re really feeling .
tell me .
i can' t .
i don' t know .
running away won' t change anything !
you' re the one that' s running away !
stop pretending !
enough , duo .
i' ve had enough !
there' s no time .
they' re on their way .
you betrayed us , didn' t you ?
operator , please !
get me out of here right now .
operator , i need an exit !
it' s no use .
i told you .
i' ve blocked your signal .
you won' t stop me .
this is your last chance .
the choice isn' t that hard .
come with me .
you can forget about it , duo .
i won' t look away from the truth .
i can' t .
that' s too bad .
i' m sorry .
i wanted to go back with you .
i love you .
no !
relax , you' re okay .
easy , cis , settle down .
he was just part of the training program .
he' s just a simulation .
it' s over .
it was a test .
judgment .
concentration .
technique .
high scores on everything .
now , get some rest .
you okay ?
i feel a lot better now .
except for that last part ... ... l' d say she passed .
a case to end all cases .
you know what i mean , dinah ?
i used to think being a private detective was cool .
like sam spade or phillip marlowe , right ?
but there' s nothing cool left to it .
on top of that , both my fridge and my bank account are empty .
wait .
okay , dinah , let' s bet .
lf it' s another suspicious husband , i' m out of this business forever .
hello ?
mr. ash , i have a job for you .
and you need me to check on your wife , right ?
i' m looking for a computer hacker .
this hacker goes by the alias trinity .
that' s all we know .
well , it looks like we' re still in business , dinah .
fine .
and who will i be working for ?
i can' t say .
you can' t say .
call me back when you can say .
that' s not the way i do business .
it was a pleasure chatting with you .
before you hang up , take a look at your bank account balance .
i didn' t get a good feeling about the case .
but i had no good reason to turn the guy down now .
this trinity was well known in hacker circles .
a real artist by the sound of it .
the cops were always one step behind him .
so i knew i could get that close .
question was , could i get closer ?
i had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers .
while i was searching , i found something strange .
other detectives had been on the case too .
and their investigations had all been , shall we say , troubled .
one of the guys killed himself .
another had disappeared .
another went crazy .
so i paid the one who was left a visit .
the crazy one .
trinity doesn' t exist , man .
he' s not real .
he' s a figment .
a cipher .
a jabberwocky .
and who am l ?
who the hell am l ?
did i mention he was crazy ?
chessboards , jabberwocky , red queen ....
i started searching all the usual hacker hangouts ... ... for someone with an alice in wonderland m . o .
hacker bulletin boards , anonymous mailboxes , chat rooms .
and it was in one of those that i picked up trinity' s trail .
six brooks .
i' il be there at 2005 .
of course !
crossing the second brook takes her into the woods .
alice jumps the first brook ... ... and ....
and then she boards a train .
thanks .
excuse me .
hey !
hey !
i knew this was some kind of trap .
there' s a difference , mr. ash , between a trap and a test .
you were testing me ?
you made it .
i' m impressed .
flattery will get you everywhere .
i' m not here to flatter you , i' m here to save you .
what just happened ?
mr. ash , dream of having an eye exam lately ?
yeah , how' d you know ?
you' ve stepped to the edge of the looking glass .
so then , that means i wasn' t dreaming .
they hired me as a way of getting to you , didn' t they ?
go !
what the hell is going on here ?
this is really crazy .
now i understand what happened to those other detectives .
they went nuts .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , guys ?
well , i' ve gotten out of worse jams than this .
i am not gonna let them get you .
what' s happening to me ?
i' m sorry .
you didn' t make it , mr. ash .
i wish ...
... l could go with you .
i don' t blame you , you know .
everything that happened , trinity , it was all my fault .
all that through the looking glass stuff .
can' t get my head around it .
i' m old fashioned .
there' s a difference between a test and a choice .
for what it' s worth , i think you could' ve handled the truth .
it was just a job .
goodbye , trinity .
goodbye .
a case to end all cases .
yuki !
hey , girl , time to eat .
oh , yuki' s my cat .
well , i don' t understand .
lf you don' t want to go out with him , why did you say you would ?
i mean , you don' t want to give him the wrong idea , do you ?
where is she ?
yuki !
well , listen , you need to make up your mind .
where is she ?
i' m starting to worry about my cat .
she never misses a meal .
yuki ?
i' m gonna have to call you back .

she' s at the old haunted house .
hey , look !
there' s a rainbow over there again .
i don' t get it .
she likes to stay home .
what is she doing over there ?
you know , you' re not supposed to go in there ... ... but we don' t really care about that .
you wanna go ?

it' s probably raining there again .
let' s go !
nice moves , man .

hey , it' s over here .
wait , i' m coming with you .

yeah , thanks .
it' s those boys .

there he goes .
banzai !
yes !
may i have your attention , please .
and you are the winner !
no fair .
he hit the ground .
his nose is bleeding .
look !
i think he' s right .
he hit the ground .
hey , who told her ?
don' t look at me .
i don' t know .
i didn' t tell her .
so this house is haunted .
no way .
wow , this is too much !
this never happened before .
that , that was what was that ?
hi .
anybody home ?
yeah , they' re gonna tear it down .
come on , come on , come on !
hey , light as a feather .
i wanna try !
i wanna try !
come on , we could help her .
hey , hey !
come on .
get away from there .
move along !
yuki , wait !
clear the area .
clear the area immediately .
get out of here !
yuki !
where are you ?
yuki !
yuki !
yuki .
if you don' t want to go out with him , why did you say you would ?
i mean , you don' t wanna give him the wrong idea .
where is she ?
yuki !
you need to make up your mind .
where is she ?
i' m starting to worry .
yuki !
hey , you !
we' ve got one over here .
you don' t belong here .
move along , folks .
nothing to see here .
come on , folks , out of the way .
go about your business .
let go of me , let go !
tell me you have all of them .
yes , sir .
the last one' s over there .
examine her .
then let her go .
yes , sir .
let go !
listen to me !
there' s no bugs in there !
it' s just some kids !
let go !
listen !
seal the area off now .
i' m going , i' il see you guys later .
nothing .
yeah , nothing .
work !
it' s not working .
forget it .
come on , let' s go .
wake up .
baby' s spotted two machines heading in fast .
i see them .
they' re runners .
think you can handle them ?
watch me .
okay .
i' m in .
that runner' s smarter than we' ve seen so far .
it' s quite a catch .
thanks .
will it ?
do you think it' il convert ?
to convert is its choice to make .
do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it ?
no .
we can' t make slaves of them .
because that would be simpler .
we won' t beat the machines by making them our slaves .
better to let them join us by choice .
make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make .
all right .
yes , machines are tools .
they' re made to be used .
it' s their nature .
to be slaves .
that' s why we can show them a better world , why they convert .
but that world we show them isn' t real .
it doesn' t matter .
i' m afraid they' il figure out that we' ve made up the thing in our heads .
they can' t tell the difference .
to an artificial mind , all reality is virtual .
how do they know that the real world isn' t just another simulation ?
how do you ?
i know i' m not dreaming now because i know what it' s like being in a dream .
so dreaming lets you know reality exists .
no .
just that my mind exists .
i don' t know about the rest .
okay , he' s good to go .
looks like we are too .
dreaming already ?
he' s had a rough day .
you poor baby .
would you mind ?
not at all .
hello there .
what' s happening ?
sentinels .
let' s go !
come on , damn it , help me !
only the most exceptional people become aware of the matrix .
those that learn it exists ... ... must posses a rare degree of intuition , sensitivity and a questioning nature .
signal is stable .
this frequency will continue to remain open .
however , very rarely ... ... some gain this wisdom through wholly different means .
this man is one of those few .
gentlemen , please take your marks !
of course i believe you , dan .
it' s got to be some kind of mix up .
you' il clear it up , and if you can' t , you' il go on .
just like you' ve always done .
you know that .
i don' t know , dad .
i don' t know what to believe in anymore .
well , nothing worth doing in life is easy .
and i have great faith in you , son .
i know you can do it .
thanks , dad .
this is no good , dan !
your muscles are about to burst !
listen to me , there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldn' t
i know , but i' m not withdrawing , tom .
does the concept " first in qualifying " mean anything to you ?
that' s enough already !
you hear me ?
this is all we' ve worked for !
lnjure yourself now and it' s over !
you' il lose everything !
over !
and you can kiss your career goodbye !
i' ve made up my mind .
and i' m running tomorrow .
oh , are you ?
you may run , but if you push yourself any more ... ... you' il be lucky to break nine minutes !
i mean , why bother ?
it' s just not worth it , buddy .
no one will ever beat my record .
it' s the last chance for me to finally
what ?
prove them wrong .
then do it without me .
hey , dan , you got a second ?
the clock' s ticking .
just wanted to ask a few questions .
you must be excited to run tomorrow .
always .
i' ve never felt this good .
so , what was it like breaking 9 . 8 in the qualifying heat ?
like nothing i' ve ever felt before .
it' s everything i' ve worked for .
and now i' m just hoping i can get back there again .
someone once said it feels like zero gravity .
you' re released from the world and you' re totally free .
that sounds amazing .
it must be really nice .
i mean , especially considering what happened .
well , i' il tell you , there aren' t any reporters out there .
all right , dan , i guess i' m going to take that as my cue .
but you should know even some of us reporters are fans ...
... so i' il just say good luck to you .
american dan davis is down !
i have an unstable signal .
he cannot wake up .
do not let him wake up .
dan davis of the united states finishes with a time of 8 . 7 2 seconds ... ... a new world record .
i' il tell you something ...
... there' s nothing quite like cherry pie baked by my aunt daisy .
she always bakes me one when i visit .
look forward to it actually .
it may sound like i' m bragging , but it' s really the best cherry pie in the world .
she was a bit of an eccentric .
she didn' t get along with my mom ... ... but i always loved her .
she taught me so many things .
we' d go to broadway musicals , to the movies .
now they call her the " queen of mystery literature .
lives in an elegant villa in the south of france .
but , when i go visit , she still bakes me her cherry pie .
something about biting into it , just for that brief moment tasting perfection .
like leaving your body or something .
anyone can write a novel , but no one can beat her cherry pie .
an interesting case , but nothing to be concerned about .
his memory of the race was expunged with no residual effects .
he will never run again .
he will never walk again , for that matter .
we' il continue monitoring him for a while , but anticipate no problems .
a record that will live on in people' s memories for years to come .
what more could anyone ask for ?
free ....
did you say something ?
sit down .
free ....
sit down !
mr. popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom ?
i' m sorry , sir .
yes , well ... ... you' re barely passing my class as it is , mr. popper .
it won' t happen again , sir .
for your sake , i hope not .
i turned it off .
i know i did .
they know you know .
they' re coming for you .
get out .
get out now !
you are in serious trouble , mr. popper .
stop right there !
mr. popper .
neo , i believe .
i know it wasn' t a dream .
this is not real .
and the real world lies somewhere else .
a typical mental delusion .
we get unbalanced kids like this all the time .
reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people .
this world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that .
it' s called denying reality .
it' s , you know , just a self defense mechanism for those type of kids .
well , he' s in another world now .
make no mistake about that .
his vitals are good .
he' s gonna make it .
it' s unbelievable .
i didn' t think self substantiation was possible .
apparently , it is .
neo .
it' s okay .
you' re safe now .
i knew ... ... you' d save me .
i didn' t save you , kid .
you saved yourself .
