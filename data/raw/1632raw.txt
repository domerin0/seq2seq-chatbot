the jaguar

he' s too tired to talk now .
your reservation' s confirmed .
welcome to the crillon hotel , mr. stevens .
your suite is ready .
i think your cause is important .
4th floor .

we' il get help at once .
nothing serious .
ok , thanks .
they' il have it fixed in a jiffy .
sorry about that .
no harm done .
whatever turns him on .
we' re trapped here with you know who .
he' s fondling one of the guests .
the ears .
ok , thanks .
they' re done .
good !
i' m claustrophobic .
just a few seconds now .
don' t worry , he' s a very gentle fellow .
i' m not worried .
now what ?
grab his nose .
the nose is the breath of life .
you' re saying that your lives matter to one another .
really ?
how long will we be saying this ?
so much for that !
this is incredible .
why ?
you' re the 1 st white man who' s interested him .
he has a nice face .
he' s a respected shaman of the amazon rainforest .
it' s about time !
' night .
keep up the good work .
thanks .
sorry if he bothered you .
forget it .
so long .
i really am sorry .
i don' t know what' s got into him .
that' s all right .
goodnight .
late , as usual .
i have an excuse .
let' s hear it .
a shaman grabbed my nose in the elevator .
right !
it' s true !
that rainforest guy on the world tour ...
you look great .
why' d you call me ?
had to see you .
after a year , you suddenly have to see me ?
what' s this ?
i' m saying your life matters to me .
photo op at 9 , government meeting at 11 , then we' il do afternoon talk shows .
what' s that ?
what' d he want ?
he had a bad dream last night .
a man in the amazon stole his soul .
he couldn' t prevent it , since he was so far away .
so he had a bad night .
he' il get over it .
i' m right down the hall .
this dream stuff bothers me .
it' il be forgotten by the morning !
he said something odd .
what ?
that he' d met the " chosen one .
chosen one ?
how much ?
100, 000 .
dollars ?
i' m on to a big score .
i' il pay you back next week .
what' s so funny ?
so that' s why you called me !
i wanted to see you , not tell you my problems !
it' s late , tomorrow' s a big day , and i' m beat !
ok , i' il leave !
can i get dressed first ?
anna ?
you asleep ?
look , i' m in deep shit .
i lost at poker , wrote bum checks .
so what else is new ?
it gets heavy .
the guy i owe sold my debt to a loan shark in the mob !
i' m sleepy .
i don' t believe this !
my life' s in danger and you' re sleepy !
you asked everyone else , right ?
not at all !
even if i had $100, 000 , you wouldn' t see it !
it' s fake .
why say that ?
just a thought .
franois !
why don' t you try working for a change ?
goodnight , sir .
what' re you doing here ?
aren' t you cold ?
you' re shivering !
they let you out half naked !
put this on !
put it on !
you' il catch your death !
let' s go in .
now what ?
that' s nice , but i couldn' t ...
happy now ?
come on .
found him outside .
isn' t he guarded ?
he' s your problem .
i' m outta here .
gimme the coat .
you take the beads , i take the coat .
this is too tricky .
get the damn interpreter , i want my coat .
it' s 4 a . m .
i didn' t ask the time .
my coat is cashmere !
who needs these crappy beads ?
ok , i' il call at once .
no , thanks .
goddam trading post !
terribly sorry .
he' s never gone out alone .
i want to have my coat ... and give these back .
that' s a tough one !
why ?
if you' ve initiated the gift ritual ...
what ritual ?
i' m not into ritual !
to take a gift back is a major insult .
what gift ?
it' s cold , i lent him my coat .
now i need it to go home .
tell this bozo to stop !
a fertility necklace !
it' s a sign of respect .
i want my coat now ... or else !
i' il get my checkbook .
what for ?
to buy the coat .
he can' t imagine a friend taking it back .
what have i done ?
tell me how much i owe you .
never mind !
it' s out of your league .
keep it .
i need way more cash than that !
i' m very touched , sir .
my name' s jean campana .
do i get my keys back ?
does he keep my car ?
i said it was your fetish .
nice move !
goodnight .
no !
you stay !
you not come !
put him on a leash so i can split !
you scared me !
what' re you doing ?
don' t move !
crillon hotel ?

it' s not so great .
comes from the deli downstairs .
you don' t care .
what' s up , geronimo ?
why am i your friend ?
still hungry ?
it' s a quiche .
it' s lousy , but the deli lets me buy on credit .
you don' t know about debts , credit ratings , collection agencies ...
where' s your interpreter ?
i' m not bored , i' m bushed .

i got some brandy .
keep the chill off .
strong , huh ?
what' s keeping him ?
is he coming by canoe ?
damn , i' m sleepy !
i gotta lie down .
no one home ?
we get it wrong ?
no , franois perrin , 6th floor .
what' s he up to ?
let' s call the police .
who is it ?
you can take him .
what are you staring at ?
take him and get lost !
sorry , but we came by earlier ...
i fell asleep .
he' s all yours , goodbye !
will he go now ?
i' il handle it .
thanks for coming , it' s alright now .
you' re sure ?
yes , thanks .
i' il be in the car .
i' il reschedule the day .
alright !
what happened ?
i don' t know .
and i don' t care !
talk outside .
i' m crashing !
i asked him why he painted symbols on your face .
he did what ?
shit !
the guy' s nuts !
he says you' re good .
your soul' s clear and beautiful .
so why the paint ?
looks like an initiation rite to me .
those totems and crosses on your face .
that' s what it looks like .
tell him to do his graffiti elsewhere !
i wish i knew .
now what ?
he thanks you for the gifts .
he should !
don' t wash off the paint for a few days .
oh , sure !
he says you' re the chosen one .
right .
he has chosen you , mr perrin .
but what for ?
only you can help .
yeah , sure !
see you around , good luck .
goodbye , thanks for everything .
wait !
someone stole his soul .
know what that means to an indian ?
who cares ?
see you again , mr. stevens thank you , minister .
france cares about the amazon rainforest and its inhabitants .
we' il do our best to help .
goodbye , minister .
what' s the matter ?
get a doctor , quick !
11 o' clock news .
wanu , the amazon shaman suffered a heart attack a few minutes ago .
wanu is touring europe to publicize the plight of the rainforest and its natives .
he' s in critical condition at a paris hospital .
he wants perrin .
i heard it on the radio .
how is he ?
he' s dying , wants to see you .
sorry , i can' t come to the hospital now .
look , it won' t take long .
i can send a car .
no , i' m tied up today .
why me ?
i only met him last night .
it' s crazy !
he' s formed a mysterious bond with you .
it' s rooted in indian magic .
indian magic !
i saved him from freezing .
where' s the magic ?
hey , i got water on my floor !
a flood !
shit !
he hung up !
what' s happening ?
valium ?
valium 10 , quick !
you got a week to pay up .
no more .
we' il be visiting you .
see you around .
a week !
i don' t get it .
he was clinically dead , now he needs valium !
i' ve never given a sedative to a stiff !
who did you sell my iou to ?
you shoulda paid , it' s been a year .
they just beat me up .
tell me who it is !
you won' t lose them .
they' il make you pay .
i can' t , goddammit , i need time !
if you can' t , then beat it .
skip town , blow the country , the planet !
why doesn' t he call ?
he won' t give a few minutes to a dying man !
it' s too late .
i' m going ...
where ?
to get him .
to drag him here ?
you bet i will .
hi !
now what ?
you gave me a week .
just checking on your mood .
mr perrin , i need a few minutes of your time ...
sure !
thanks for coming .
least i could do .
please .
there was another scare .
his heart was racing .
he wants you to get his soul .
what ?
his soul' s been stolen .
without it he' il die .
you must retrieve it .
time is running out .
you two are bonded .
he' il help you search .
will you go or not ?
yes .
thanks for playing along .
i pity the old guy .
he' s happy , he thinks you' il rescue his soul and he' il recover .
you must think this is ridiculous .
it is unusual .
indians believe you die unless someone recovers your soul .
fine , but why me ?
i don' t know .
thanks again for your trouble .
i bet the amazon is really something .
what ?
i haven' t had a vacation for ages , and a few days over there ...
you' d consider going ?
i have a few loose ends to tie up and if it all works out ...
i had no idea you might go .
why not ?
sounds fun .
no , it' s not " fun .
it would be no pleasure trip .
recovering a soul is a ritual .
it is long and arduous .
indian magic is no holiday .
i understand .
how interesting .
i admit i' m tempted ...
it' s a spiritual journey .
spiritual , sure ...
i' m seeing a guy today who' s crucial ...
i' il see him and then decide , ok ?
that' s him .
his name' s matecamu .
what ?
matecamu .
he' s serb , or croat , or bosnian ...
who cares ?
anyway , it' s gotta be him , his specialty is buying up gambling debts .
mr matecamu , can i talk to you ?
my name' s franois perrin , i think we' re in business .
i' m an honest man .
i always pay my debts , i have principles .
i owe you $100, 000 .
i swear i' il pay you .
but i need more time , 2 weeks at most ...
what do you do ?
sorry ?
you have a job ?
i' m in deluxe real estate , in the balearic islands .
i have a property you may like .
by the sea , pool and tennis court ...
let' s talk about it when we' ve settled our problem .
i have a son like you .
really ?
same age , same charm , same gall .
is that so ?
the creep has bugged me since he was born .
he' s a liar , a thief , a skirt chaser , a drunk , and maybe a junkie .
he' s dumb enough .
i' m not into drugs !
i' d love to murder him , but his mother protects him .
there' s nothing i can do .
could i talk to him ?
youth to youth ...
shaddup !
ok .
you get no more time .
pay up by the end of the week .
that' s impossible .
i' il tell them you need special care .
as if you were my own son .
indians are wonderful , i lived with them all my life .
my parents were anthropologists .
i was ten when they died .
i was raised by the tribe .
have a nice trip .
thanks .
time for a coffee before takeoff .
not for me .
i' il be at the gate .
you' re not leaving .
here' s $10, 000 .
i sold my car , it' s all i have .
give me my passport .
you owe $100, 000 .
i' il be back in a week , i' il pay you then .
i swear !
stop , i' il pay you !
i swear !
stop !
you' re leaving in a wheelchair !
you ok ?
who taught you to fight ?
who were those guys ?
no idea .
they followed us from paris .
i saw their car .
how odd .
that' il teach them not to steal .
we stop in rio .
i know someone in rio !
a babe i met in a disco !
she' s hot !
she gave me her number .
hope i' ve got it .
she may have a chick for you !
we only have an hour to make the flight to the amazon .
wanu gave me this for you .
wear it around your neck .
around your neck !
you hear me , perrin ?
sure , around my neck .
it' s of great spiritual value .
take it out of your pocket .
a million for the new ferrari !
what a powerhouse !
what' s with you ?
think of your mission .
i am !
give me the pouch .
what pouch ?
oh , yeah .
you never asked what' s in it .
so i' il ask .
what' s in the pouch ?
rock crystals containing the spirits of the forests and rivers .
glad i asked .
perrin ...
you' re hurting me !
believe in it .
i will , but don' t break my arm !
you' re leaving paris because you' re in a bind .
don' t try to run out on me .
never occurred to me !
happy now ?
never take it off , it' s how wanu sends you his strength .
what' s so funny ?
wanu' s strength ...
he weighs 75lbs ...
and right now , the poor guy ...
don' t kid yourself , wanu is very strong .
it' s spiritual .
the indians call him the jaguar .
he has its power and speed .
some claim he can become a jaguar at will .
you believe that crap ?
i don' t know .
but it does more for me than your $1 million ferrari .
it' s no venice !
matupa' s a goldrush town .
it can get mean .
we' re here one night .
you can find gold here ?
not you .
it' s hard work .
what is it ?
that' s kumare' s plane .
who ?
scenery' s improving .
her guy' s a killer .
so are his guards !
ok , forget it .
an indian worse than white trash .
i just like his chick .
the asshole did it on purpose !
he knows i fight to rid the forest of his kind .
he' s a disaster for the whole planet !
spare me the greenpeace crap .
i like the chick' s ass ...
this is the main street .
they all dig for gold ?
most of them , yes .
do they ever play poker , to relax ?
forget it , perrin .
that' s the hotel ?
the best place in town .
passport .
not very fancy , but for one night ...
no , it' s charming .
don' t worry , tomorrow we' il be in the forest .
it' s so beautiful !
you get around a lot ?
what ?
no , i bet it' s great .
wanu' s village is 2 days by canoe .
it' s hot , there' s mosquitoes ... but it' s fabulous .
i can' t wait .
we shower and meet in the bar ?
right , see you later .
when' s the next flight to rio ?
what ?

here' s your junk , gimme my passport !
you volunteered , you' re staying !
i' m outta here , and fast .
i' il find you and kill you .
would i search the jungle to find a soul ?
armed with a butterfly net ?
this is the 20th century !
forest spirits , wizards who become jaguars , that' s over !
why did wanu pick you ?
beats me , too .
passport !
i' il make a bundle here to cover my air fare .
you' il get a bonus .
i got one on the plane .

i did ?
you mangled the bloodiest killer in the amazon .
i did what ?
she says you were in a trance .
what' s this bullshit ?
where' s your friend ?
what friend ?
the gringo you were with in the bar .
i hardly know him .
he just bought me a beer .
who is he ?
i don' t know , i swear it .
he' s french , that' s all i know !
he bought me a beer .
who is he ?
i was drugged .
that' s it .
the barkeep spiked my drink ...
nobody drugged you , you were in a trance .
he entered you , you had his strength !
he helped you fight !
from his hospital bed .
it' s fantastic !
no !
now we' il get wanu' s soul back and he' il survive .
i don' t want to !
i won' t be possessed by some indian !
i won' t become his zombie !
i refuse to believe this crap !
i want out !
take me to the airport .
perrin , listen ...
our deal wasn' t for trances or killers on my tail !
i' m leaving , take me to the airport !
can that jerk fix it ?
damn bugs !
what' s she doing ?
looking for plants .
plants ?
we' re on the lam and she picks flowers ?
they' re for you .
i didn' t ask her !
they repel mosquitoes .
you' d be eaten alive .
what' s her name ?
maya .
why' s she with kumare ?
he slaughtered her family , then kidnapped her .
nice country .
what' il you do with her ?
keep him from finding her .
she should go to new york , paris ...
with her looks , she' d do ok .
as a hooker , you mean ?
no .
new clothes , make up , she' d be a top model .
think so ?
she' d wind up on the street , not the cover of vogue .
the hell with it .
i never asked her to help me .
give her my dough .
i' il be fine .
are we there yet ?
you gonna ask every 5 minutes ?
you said 2 hours .
is your airport on the run , too ?
get me to an air conditioned suite in rio !
i want to freeze to death !
answer this question .
yeah ?
why was kumare so interested in that pouch ?
who cares ?
i' m in rio , in a cool room ...
kumare stole wanu' s soul .
now i' m sure .
kumare' s a man of today .
he' s into aircraft , not witchcraft .
ran his spread with a computer , but he used witchcraft to kill his neighbor' s cows .
get down !
why didn' t he shoot ?
he' s having fun .
come on !
you ok ?
no ...
i never buried a priest' s head before .
he' il never give up .
no .
in paris two thugs were after me .
here it' s headhunters !
i made a lousy deal !
come with me .
where ?
to unload the boat .
we' il take the forest route .
careful where you step .
what are you doing ?
let' s go .
hang in there .
we' re close to the village now .
what village ?
wanu' s .
we' il be there before dark .
we' re not going to the airport ?
the village is on the way .
liar .
it' s only a slight detour .
bastard !
we' il be safer there .
wanu' s men are friendly , they hate kumare .
i won' t go .
i won' t be pushed around !
the airport , or i stay here !
what' s he saying ?
he won' t go to the village .
she asks you to come .
she says only you can kill kumare .
crap !
you taking me to the airport ?
she begs you not to desert her .
she believes in you !
she knows you' il beat him .
she' s wrong !
like your pal in paris !
i' m not who she thinks .
let' s go !
she was wrong to help you .
you' re worthless .
i don' t care what you two think of me !
here' s my rifle , a machete , some water and matches .
light a fire at night because of the jaguars .
don' t kill birds .
their brains are nutritious .
you kidding ?
not at all .
you lied in the hospital .
a trip to the amazon ...
could be fun ...
i' m tempted !
now you dump me .
good luck , perrin !
watch out for snakes , spiders and scorpions .
let' s go !
wait for me , assholes !
shit !
move !
gotta get there before dark .
we' ve lost enough time .
take me to the airport or i' il kill you !
do what i say or i' il shoot !
snake !
gimme the gun .
easy , no sudden moves .
it' s not poisonous .
let' s go !
coming ?
i was screwed from the start .
when i got into that elevator in paris .
a second later ...
but i stepped in , and here i am .
now what ?
we' re still in that elevator .
don' t get off .
you could save yourself if you stick it out .
sticking it out means what ?
we' il soon know .
c' mon , we can reach the village before dark .
we' re here .
you can rest .
no one here ?
sure it' s the right village ?
what' d she say ?
that she' s scared .
me , too .
i hate this place .
shut up !
i hate it !
you said his men were friendly .
where are they ?
don' t be scared , they' re our friends .
you sure ?
he says we killed wanu and took him away .
he thinks you stole the pouch from wanu .
he gave it to me .
alright .
he wants the pouch .
what' s with the pig ?
one of your gifts from the village .
there' s more to come .
what' s going on ?
you spoke to them in indian .
you said , " i am wanu' s emissary , i will help you .
was i in a trance again ?
yes .
damn !
they' re counting on you .
they are ?
to get rid of kumare .
you joking ?
no .
they now think kumare stole wanu' s soul .
i told them you' il get it back .
get rid of the goddam pig !
kumare stole wanu' s soul to grab his land .
it' s rich , and he' s wanted it for ages .
my head aches .
it' s that pig , and your fairy tale ...
it' s no fairy tale .
if kumare wins , wanu dies , the forest' s doomed .
the chief gives you his hut .
it' s the biggest .
why ?
i don' t want his hut !
what do i do with this ?
take it or he' il be offended .
what must i do ?
fight that monster ?
she says you' il kill him .
she knew it when she met you .
tell her to cool it .
you' il kill him and she' il bear your child .
he' s come for the ritual painting .
i need air .
i won' t fight kumare !
i' m not their champ !
want to keep your head ?
what ?
yours will soon be stuck on a spear !
you knew in paris it would come to this ?
no , i' ve never steered anyone into a trap .

a messenger from kumare .

he' s a specialist in black magic .
he stole wanu' s soul for kumare .
why' s he here ?
to plan your duel with kumare .
i said i won' t fight !
then they' il cut our throats .
so what' s next ?
i put on my shoes .
he says kumare doesn' t fear you .
you die at sundown .
say something , or he' il think you' re scared .
i want to puke .
i told him you say kumare is scum .
you' re nuts !
don' t provoke him !
he blew in your face , that' s contempt .
retaliate !
i' m sick of your dumb rituals !
i' m hot , scared and fed up !
spit in his face .

if you don' t , you' il lose face .
spit in his face !

dozens of blowpipes are aimed at you .
do what i say , dammit !

perrin , go on !

they' il take you to san pedro mission .
it' s a few hours from here .
you can catch a plane there .

so despise me , all of you !
i don' t care !
i' m sane !
this is wanu' s mess !
ok , so long .
why didn' t he help me ?

i stood there with that knife ...
maybe he' s dead .
if he' s dead , why fight ?

for them .
leave with me , forget this .
i can' t .
why not ?
i promised .
damn your promise to this bunch !
kumare' s their problem .
don' t be dumb , come with me .
good luck , perrin .
the boy scout of the amazon , ready to die !
look at him !
campana !
sorry .
i didn' t belong on this trip .
i' m out of my depth .
sorry about her , too .
i was despicable .
her pity got on my nerves .
i meant no harm , she' s a poor kid ...
no , she' s magnificent !
i' m the creep !
my rolex , worth five grand .
it' s all i have .
give it to her .
in case she has money problems ...
and give her my dough , ok ?
tell her ...
maya ... you ok ?
campana !
you' re hurt .
i' il take you to the mission .
thirsty ...
when did we leave ?
half an hour ago .
you' ve been out .
you' ve lost blood .
we' il take you to civilization .
you crazy ?
you can' t fight with a busted shoulder !
hold it !
stop !
i have to do it .
he tried to kill her !
one arm' s enough !
stay with him ...
be happy , maya .
god bless you , campana .
you can barely stand !
it' s mad !
go .
don' t feel bad , you did more than your share .
take care of her , that' s all i ask .
this time he' s a goner .
can someone else take over ?
where' s he going ?
where are you going ?
there they are !
thank you , mr perrin .
you were great .
he' s glad to be back .
your country' s too cold .
his is stifling , that' s no better .
what a dump !
perrin never left the amazon .
he lives with maya in wanu' s village and now fiercely defends the indians and the rainforest .
if you run into him , he' il tell you that the crillon hotel elevator took him higher a lot higher , than he ever dreamed .
and that searching for an old indian' s soul ... he found his own .
