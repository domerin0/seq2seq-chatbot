to anyone opening bid ?
around our subject is a paper handler who study working on the east coast in the last few weeks is devoloping a new form of chek fraud wich encoding the flot what he' s doing is opening a checking acount at various banks and then changing the micro encoding numbers at the bottom of those checks
next slide please , ... the remote i think is broken ...

this is a map of the 12 banks of th us federeal reserves

carl ? for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud
you may telling us what the hell you are talking about the east coast branches , at number 01 the 06 , ... 07 and 08 so one so far
minus numbers on the bottom of the checks actually means something
all this was in the report i filed two days ago
if you change the 02 to a 12 . that means that check wich' s cashed in new york , is not go to new york federal branch , but is reruted all the way to ...
san francisco federal branch
