shit .
fell off the chair .
i wasn' t , uh ...
i know you' re wearing a skirt , but i didn' t see anything .
mostly trousers these days .
yeah , i prefer skirts .
healthier , isn' t it ?
i imagine .
allows the air to , uh , circulate around the ...
.. vagina !
we' re ready for you , mr garden .
yes , yes .
we' ve had a letter of complaint stating that you are a " negative and destructive influence
on the smooth running of the blackpool probation office .
i think whoever wrote that letter , it' s just a clash of personalities .
it' s signed by everyone in your office .
right , yeah , well , i mean , that' s what i mean .
it' s a clash between ... me and them .
a negative and destructive influence , " mr garden .
are they right ?
well , if you think that remembering a client' s first name is less important than claiming generous expenses , then , yes , they' re right .
if it' s best for a client who' s just left prison for the 14th time to be passed on to yet another department , then , yes , they' re right .
but i' ve seen over 1, 000 clients and i believe every single one ...
of these 1, 000 , how many are now going straight ?
three .
simon garden was an inspiration .
my first day out , he gave me a blank sheet of paper and he said , " that' s your future .
you can write and apply for a job or you can wipe your arse on it .
and i said , " i' m not afraid to get my hands dirty .
before i met simon , i was thievin ' and hitting people .
but now ...
i' m a fishmonger .
it' s another string to me bow .
12 months ago , i was in prison .
now i' m a sub service support network supervisor providing pc , mac and mainframe infrastructure with online e task back up .
not many people can say that .
do you have anything to add regarding mr garden ?
he is annoying .
it' s true .
he is annoying .
we talked to your clients , mr garden .
they' re good people .
i used to say ,
you' re halfway up a mountain .
crime is the easy path to the bottom .
responsibility is the hard path to the top .
but when you get there , it' s a great view .
" cos in every sinner ...
thank you .
there' s a vacancy in manchester .
i' il take it .

that' s why man u are winning everything .
it' s down to money .
where' s cochran ?

you' re insured for fire and theft .
got something for me ?
lovely .
why the bonus ?
golden handshake .
market' s flooded with class a.
gram of coke' s 40 quid .

so we' re goin ' legit .
yeah , well , just one problem with that as far as i can see .
me .
and me .
that' s , uh , two problems .
we can' t push our luck .

what are you doing here ?
i really don' t know .
oh , look , he' s alive !
get him !
there he is !
uh , right , listen .
could i just say something ?
if you attack me , i will go to the police .
it' il be reported .
you' il have a criminal record .
you' ve got one .
ok .
in my wallet , i' ve got ... 40 !
that' s 20 each .
plus a cash card .
it' s got a 200 limit , of which i' ve withdrawn 40 .
you' ve got that .

it' s the battle of hastings .
oh !
oh , my god !
oh !
oh , that really hurt !
oh , oh ...
oh , bloody shit !
bloody hell !
where is he ?

i dunno .
no sign of him .
' good morning , manchester .
it' s 8 : 00 .
' a man out walking his dog made a gruesome discovery
' when he came across a headless corpse on the stockport canal .
' police urgently seek the owner of a wallet found near the body ... '
hello , my name is simon garden .
i' d like to report a murder .
erm ...
i know i look a mess .
i , uh ...
i slept rough last night .
i got punched in the face by a man with a stick .
fell off a roof into a canal .
actually got a condom stuck on my finger .
eugh .
i' m not a lunatic .
i' m a probation officer .
um ...
i know , same thing .
but , no , this is murder and i' d like to speak to a senior officer , please .
certainly , sir .
good .
oh .
hello , simon .
hello .
i reckon we should , you know , rub him out .
we can' t rub people out .
we' re police officers .
aye , of course .
what about the accountant ?
that was unfortunate .
are you just gonna let him go ?
for the time being .
he' s a very scared boy .
he' il probably go back to do gooding in toy town .
if he does talk , we' il pay him a visit .
he' il find a kilo of colombia' s finest and a head in his fridge .
let' s look at the facts .
i' m in charge of the investigation .
your wallet' s found near the body .
you' re ... " helping police with their enquiries " .
you' re in a lot of trouble .
but hang on .
i think i can help you .
if you keep your mouth shut , the murderer may never be found .
you can' t intimidate me .
let me give it a shot .
if you open your mouth ...
i won' t lay a finger on you , but you' il go to prison .
and when those nonces and perverts get hold of a clever boy like you , and i' il make sure they do , they' re gonna be queuing up round the block .
you' re gonna end up with an arsehole like a clown' s pocket .
that was pretty good .
do you like thai food ?
why ?
i thought you' d like to celebrate that you' re no longer a suspect .
i can' t .
i' m leaving .
i' m not really up to the job here , so i thought i' d go back to my old one .
if they' il have me .
well , what about a goodbye dinner ?
it' s probably best if i just go .
i was going with a bunch of mates .
i thought you might join us .
that' s all .
don' t worry .
you won' t be missed .
listen .
it' s been really , really nice working with you .
good luck with your career .
you' il go from strength to strength .
ditto .
# i ain' t got no home , ain' t go no shoes

' inspector , four days ago
' you rescued a 15 year old girl from a burning car .
' what' s it like to be a hero ? '
' i was just doing my job ,
' and any other officer would have done the same as me .
' if this thing helps people see through the uniform , that' s great . '
' you' re to receive this year' s police federation bravery medal .

ah , sex !
bill , have we got any more of that sake ?
ah .
bill .

i' ve just given it to the boss .

thank you .
hang on .
who are you ?
john .
john jones .
jj .
can i help you ?
you' re nicked .
what ?
i ...
oh , my god !
emma , it' s you !
so i thought you were leaving town .
uh , no , i i changed my mind .
you look absolutely gorgeous .
i' m a prostitute .
right .
why ?
don' t the police pay you enough ?
no , i' m undercover .
very convincing .
yeah .
you fooled me .
we can' t really talk here .
why ?
miami vice .
do you want a coffee ?
yes .
why were you staring at that bank ?
um , i' m thinking of robbing it .
simon !
hello , george .
come in , come in .
anyone fallen off the roller coaster recently ?
no .
i inspect it every day .
don' t worry about me , simon .
i will never go back to a life of crime , and it' s all down to you .
so , if you ever want a favour , all you have to do is ask .
well , i' m glad you say that .
because i would like you to help me ...
yes ?
.. rob a bank .
this is a test , isn' t it ?
no , no .
no , this is technically not a crime .
we' re not taking money .
just a videotape of a murder .
george , it was horrific .
i saw a man strangle a human being .
well , an accountant .
no , you can' t tempt me .
the murderer is a police officer ...
no . .. in charge of the ...
no !
this is not role play .
i can' t go to the police .
i' ve been framed !
i' ve no one else to turn to .
look , you always said crime is the easy path to the bottom .
and now you want me to rob a bank ?
it' s like asking a reformed drug addict to have one last hit .
what do you think about what i just said ?
oh .
that makes sense .
i shouldn' t have had that curry .
but i' m all right now .
sorry !
let me off !
let me off !
hang on !
but you used to say ,
you' re halfway up a mountain .
crime' s the easy path down .
" responsibility ...
" get there , it' s a great view .
yeah .
well , don' t that make you a hypocrite ?
in these circumstances , no .
oh , look , simon , it' s not that i don' t want to help you .
it' s just , erm ...
it' s me mum .
she' s got crippling arthritis .
she can hardly move .
you know , i' ve got the shop , i' ve got her and , you know , a couple of chairs have been kicked over in the attic .
she don' t know why there' s fish everywhere .
otherwise i' d be in that car with you now .
hey , rambo !
them hake in there want guttin ' .
i could' ve fried ' em , ate ' em , and shat ' em out by now .
give it your mum .
you big girl .
i was such an idiot .
but now i' m not an idiot .
i' m a computer salesman , thanks to you .
the beauty is they sell themselves .
all i do is provide a service support network for a small fee , which keeps the customers happy , and me .
i' m very happy .
i' m very happy .
oh , that was a shite job .
i hated it .
ah !
we' re all in .
manchester , here we come .
not quite .
there' s one more .
victor ?
who' s victor ?
there was a story that victor once stole the crown jewels and then put them back without anyone noticing .
how do you know if no one saw it ?
i read it in news of the world .
yep , that' s were i read it .
he' s a master of disguise .
yep .
sometimes even i don' t recognise him .
victor ?
i' m victor' s wife .
after he worked with you , he tried to give up his life of crime by channelling his interests into amateur dramatics .
but one night he sneaked off to do the safe at jackson' s food processing plant .
two days later , a machine was playing up .
they reckon he must have fallen into the mincer .
by that stage , the orders had already gone out .
they tried to recall them , but all they got back was half a dozen pies and a couple of pasties .
and is that what' s ...
yes .
what a waste .
er , of human life .
hm .
he was very fond of you he had some tools i' m sure he would' ve wanted you to have .
thanks .
i don' t think we' ve got a lawnmower .
sorry .
i' m afraid he was a bit of a hoarder .
wow , a dtl .
a what ?
digital transmission imager .
oh , check this out .
don' t shoot .
it' s a fisheye lens .
victor obviously had a sense of humour .
there' s masses of it .
what' s this ?
a flask .
for ?
tea , coffee , hot bovril .
we' il take it .
welcome to my humble abode .
there' s just one rule .
do you mind popping your shoes off ?
it' s a new carpet and ... you know .
apart from that , make yourselves at home .
sleeping arrangements .
i have a spare bedroom ...
thank you very much .
sofa bed ...
mine .
inflatable mattress ...
bags that !
good .
food .
who' s hungry ?
yeah .
we got hummus , taramasalata , uh , couscous , tabouleh , stuffed olives , cheese .
where' s the cheese ?
in the fridge .
have you got any bread ?
uh , focaccia .
is that sliced ?
well , it' s , uh , prt manger .
no , it' s not sliced .
right .
ok , the bank .
top view .
side road here .
front door .
uh , three windows .
stairs to the left and a door at the back , which i think leads to the vault .
so , pretty basic .
but ...
what' s stopping us getting into the vault to get the tape ?
that' s not important .
the doors are bomb proof , the windows are toughened glass ,
there' s no adjoining building .
cctv outside and inside .
dual circuit alarm on the doors .
heat and motion in every room .
electronically linked , via a control centre , to the police .
and there' s the vault surrounded by concrete three feet thick .
a big two tonne door .
a combination lock changed weekly and a preset time lock .
which can only be changed from the inside .
some fresh coffee ?
you isolate the power supply to the system and cut it off !
it' s not an integrated circuit .
you got back up systems .
if you go near the power , you' il trigger the alarm .
discreet transistor crap that' s last year' s old news !
blow it up , get the money and go .
shut up !
you mean the tape , not the money .
oh , yeah .
blondie , if you want to pick holes , be my guest .
but i don' t hear a better idea .
it' s last year' s old news !
if you don' t have anything to say , shut up !
tell him to stop saying " it is last year' s old news " !
it is annoying .
he acts like a council official .
i am a council official !
colin , what is today' s news ?
a tsmlsp .
tsimps ?
a target specific multi invasive subversion program .
he means a computer virus .
he' s taking the piss !
you want me to hit him ?
just try it , fishface .
ow !
that really hurt !
now , listen , i' m very grateful you' ve all agreed to help me rob a bank .
but this is not a competition .
we have to act as a team .
now , we' re all very different people , and that' s a good thing .
jeff here likes oasis .
colin likes ...
what do you like ?
hardcore belgian trance .
great !
george likes the beach boys .
he likes them .
i' m a bit of a deep purple nut .
uh , smoke on the water ?
actually the result of a jamming session in montreux .
casino was on fire , they saw the smoke ...
anyway , the point is ...
we should get on with it .
exactly .
now , colin , what is a tsmlsp ?
and would telling us about it be a waste of our time ?
it locates all the alarm systems at the control centre .
would that target our bank alarm ?
it can' t .
it attacks all of them .
that won' t shut the systems down .
you' re more likely to set off every bank alarm in the city .
colin , have an extra slice of toast .
i think we deserve the morning off .
emma ?
hi , simon .
oh , hi .
i was told to come up here by , uh ...
my flatmate .
right .
just have a seat .
yeah , sure .
i' m in the shower .
ok .
what are you doing this afternoon ?
nothing .
now , no pressure , but , uh , my uncle bernard is part owner of a ... really cool narrow boat on the rochdale canal .
and , uh , as luck would have it , today' s one of his days , but , uh , he' s unwell .
uh , he' s got a problem with his ... body .
but , uh , it' s really nice inside .
it' s , uh , warm and comfortable ... and lovely .
anyway , you' ve ... you' ve got a lovely little , uh ... cat .
so , what do you think ?
about what ?
you know , uh , you , me ... narrow boat , canal .
unless you' ve got a better idea .
that is just showing off .
it' s a fertility symbol .
if you touch it , it increases your sexual potency .
right .
go on .
what ?
touch it .
no .
are you afraid to touch a penis ?
you' re talking to a guy who' s going blind .
go on .
touch it .
i' m just going to the , uh ...
don' t forget to wash your hands .
good afternoon .
it' s not what you think .
oh !
it' s wood .
hmm !
please .
please .
could you please do something about that man over there ?
emma !
emma , help !
come out , please , sir .
i know you' re in there .
i will be out in a minute .
man in ladies ' toilet .
assistance required .
suspected flasher .
' roger , maggie . '
i am not a flasher .
could you come out , please , sir ?
you shouldn' t be in the ladies ' .
i' ve got an upset stomach .
right , where' s the perv ?
get out now !
dirty bastard .
hang on .
i' m nearly done .
no , that' s it .
sorry .
bit of an emergency .
now , what' s the problem ?
you' ve been reported for indecent behaviour .
he had a lump in his trousers .
yes , i had several .
i shat myself .
now , where' s the nearest marks and spencer' s ?
straight down the high street , the first on the left .
thank you very much .
it came off in my hand .
don' t worry .
it' s happened to me a few times .
like jean claude van damme .
where ?
roller disco , oldham .
he had a big knife .
you knocked him out with one punch .
i' ve told you this before ?
all your stories end with you knocking someone out with one punch .
got some knives and forks .
yeah .
let' s use our fingers .
what the heck .
i' ve been thinkin ' .
go on .
try going through a window , it' s too visible .
but get on the roof , you' re concealed .
it buys you time .
how we gonna get in ?
i' m coming to that .
there' s a fire door .
which only opens from the inside .
hang on !
there' s like an air vent thing there , right ?
i can go through there , go around , open the fire door ,
let you all in .
brilliant .
the aperture to the air conditioning unit you are referring to is 14 inches square .
brilliant but flawed .
i could get in .
go on a diet .
you won' t want that , then .
never touch my food .
whoa !
jeff , colin , calm down .
it was a good idea .
it' s just ...  i' d rather you didn' t argue .
jeff' s got a lot on his plate at the moment .
i know , but he really makes me angry , er ... cos he talks rubbish sometimes .
but if i have upset him , i' m sorry .
that' s very big of you to say so , colin .
george , anything to add to that ?
huh ?
what ?
erm ...
erm ...
no .
jeff , you' re very quiet ...
kirsty !
what the hell are you doing here ?
i thought i' d rob you .
what you' re doing is illegal .
so is robbing a bank .
how do you know we' re robbing a bank ?
it' s written on your notice board .
right , kirsty .
if you forget about this , i' il forget about you robbing my house .
that' s not equal .
you' re robbing a bank .
w what do you want ?
to join your gang and rob a bank .
we' re not stealin ' money .
right ?
yes .
please ?
you' re too young .
i could drive the getaway car .
i' ve stolen 44 cars .
and been caught 44 times .
we don' t need you , kirsty .
i' m sorry .
right .
where were we ?
jeff had the wizard idea of gaining entry through an air duct and i pointed out that none of us could fit through it .
i could .
ladybird to praying mantra .
ladybird , receiving you .
i' m a mile away and i can still hear you .
ok , now try five miles away .
over .
even if we can break in , what do we do about the getaway ?
i' ve got an idea about that .
now , on friday , stay away from the target area until rush hour .
any questions ?
why is the protest on a weekday ?
for maximum disruption .
bollocks !
if we had it on a sunday at 12 noon , outside the west clyde bank , there' d be a bigger turnout .
yeah , some of us have to work .
yeah !
the city' s empty on a sunday !
we' il reclaim the streets .
for the kids !
friday , 5 : 00 .
it' s been decided .
who decided ?
the committee .
bollocks !
some democratic organisation !
yeah !
yeah !
it is .
the elected committee votes and we abide by the committee' s decision .
bollocks !
gonna let him push us around ?
tell him we' re not sheep .
we' re not sheep !
tell him to put it to a vote .
put it to a vote !
a good idea !
all right .
all those who want the protest
on sunday at noon ...
outside the west clyde bank . .. outside the west clyde bank , raise their hands .
yes !
hurry up !
oh , god .
it' s not a bloody marathon !
if they realise they' ve loaded a virus , won' t they tell everyone ?
would you tell anyone if you' d been looking at this ?
yeah , but it' s boring , isn' t it ?
just variations on a ...
i' ve not seen that before .
any , uh , movement on the murder investigation ?
you mean the headless accountant ?
no , bit of a dead end , that .
that probation officer ?
he' s well out of the picture .
let' s not talk shop , eh ?
i' d better be off .
one for the road .
no , thanks .
it' s an order .
vodka chaser .
let' s get it on " )
so , how' s your love life at the moment ?
no time for anything , really .
tsk !
know what you mean .
oh !
trying to get me drunk , inspector ?
yep .
i don' t believe in in house romance .
who said anything about romance ?
stick to what you' re best at .
what is it ?
it' s a gotler .
a what ?
a george operated time lock equalising robot .
this is telescopic ?
similar .
it' s hydraulic .
and once inside the vault , this emits an electromagnetic pulse at the led displays , causing the clocks to synchronise at zero , deactivating the time lock .
how' d you know that ?
i heard you phone your mother .
yeah , yeah .
she likes to know what i' m up to .
now , with the time lock , it' s a simple matter for the gotler ...
oh !
i told you .
it' s top heavy .
it' s only a small modification .
it needs a redesign .
if that goes , we all go to jail .
it won' t .
how we gonna get the bank to let us put that in the vault ?
and , uh , what did you say was inside it ? 10, 000 in coins , notes and cheques .
hopefully .
this buys beds for the children ?
and a couple of wheelchairs .
they' re disabled ?
challenged .
of course .
and blind .
are they ?
uh , some of them .
right , uh ...
well , unfortunately , we can' t allow items like this into the vault .
we might make an exception for a valuable painting or a sculpture .
excuse me .
can i shake your hand ?
yes .

why are they in your living room ?
well , they are ... part of a voluntary self help group .
we meet regularly and what i encourage them to do is not concentrate on their own problems but look at other people' s .
that' s beneficial for two reasons .
one , they' re less isolated , more able to focus , and two , i really like your knees .
and your eyes .
i mean , i like everything .
um ...
but i i really like your knees .
is that what you saw in the mirror ?

simon , what are you up to ?
i can explain .
di burton murdered trevor deacon .
what are you talking about ?
i saw him do it .
i was eating crisps behind boxes ...

burton would have framed me .
i' d be in prison .
i' d be buggered .

and what' s all this for ?
i can' t tell you .
you' re a police officer .
i thought i was your friend .

di burton did it personally .
why ?
it' s ok .
sir , can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
the murder victim , trevor deacon .
did you know him ?
no .
then why is your number in his mobile phone ?
do you think i murdered him ?
i didn' t say that .

to having friends .
yes ...
thank you .
to friends .
search warrant .
got a locked cupboard here , sir .

of course , prison food is processed , but you get used to it after about 10 years the going rate for murdering an accountant .
except i didn' t murder him .
you did .
yeah , but i' ve got an alibi .
you haven' t .
if you' re gonna frame me for murder , you should have more evidence .

i' m taking the tape to get burton .
hello .
oh , hello .
what' s on the tape ?
this ... is ...
a short film about killing by the polish director krzysztof kieslowski .
a simple story of a man who kills in the heat of the moment , then it follows the legal process , culminating in the man' s execution , which is just as futile as the murder .
and that' s the point , really , that killing is wrong .
i' ve seen it .
it' s shit .
mm .
yes , it is .
why is it called " tuesday " ?
uh ...
get after him .
security !
they' re on the way .
get the tape .

hey , hey , hey , hey !
hey !

each of these officers being honoured here today represent the force for good that i want to see in the 21st century .

oh , thanks very much .
i was wondering how i' d get hold of that .

you' ve done the job for me .
he who laughs last , laughs longest .

yes .
and what' s that ?
it' s a secret .
inspector burton ?
how do i look ?
crooked .
have we got a secret plan ?
no , we' re knackered .
hello .
hello .
where are we going ?
you tell me .
i' m very pleased today , not just cos i' m receiving this award , but also cos after a long time , this uniform still fits .
uh , excuse me !
sorry to interrupt , but i have got a gun pointed at this officer' s head , so i' m sure you' re aware the procedure is to stay calm , don' t inflame the situation and listen .
ok , my name is simon garden .
i' m a probation officer .
i have been wrongly accused of murder .
i can' t believe there are some people talking at the back .
shh !
shh !
please be quiet , or i will shoot her in the head .
thank you .
right .
i am not a murderer .
i know it doesn' t look good , but i' m not capable of murder .
i don' t even know how to fire a gun .
but ...
hey , you just pull the trigger , right ?
kirsty ?
we borrowed this money today from a bank .
it was in a safe deposit box in the name of detective inspector burton .
mr garden , take the gun away from the young officer' s head .
it' s ok .
i won' t pull the trigger ... but i might .
sir , may i ?
explain the money .
this is money that was to be used as bait in a sting on a drug syndicate i' ve infiltrated posing as a corrupt policeman .
you just wasted two years of police time , simon .
what about the tape ?
# they' ve got the policeman
# the big , friendly policeman
# pc mcgarry , number 452 #
what tape ?
thank you .
it' s a long time since i' ve said this , but i' m arresting you on suspicion of murder .
sir , i can explain .
right , now .
i' ve got the gun , and as you' ve seen , i will kill if i have to .
while you' re there , put the money in the bag , please .
there should be more than that .
ow !
if you kill me , you' il be a serial killer .
no !
you have to kill three to be a serial killer .
sorry .
that' s just america .
it' s two here .
pulling that trigger will achieve nothing .
you' il just look silly .
you need these .
and these .
whoo hoo !
nice one .
all right .
this is a police matter .
we' il take over from here .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i' il look after the money .
are you going to let me go ?
i , uh , i lost the key .
oh , well , that' s all right .
george ?
no problem .
oh , no .
that' s a spear & jackson spring lock .
you won' t be able to get those open till the morning .
colin ?
sorry .
it was just a very beautiful moment .
i' il , um ...
is that , uh ... a gun in your pocket ?
no , it' s my penis .
