why don' t you leave that man alone ?
i' m just trying to lay down for a few minutes before i go back to work .
look , if i' m not getting any sleep , you' re not getting any sleep .
<i>now , that was mean . </ i>

i just need to know enough to look like i know something .
you know how to faint ?
you mean , like , fake somebody out ?

since he failed that quiz , he can' t play in a basketball game tomorrow .
<i>thank the lord ! </ i>
you' re on the basketball team ?
you can' t play basketball .
i tried to tell him that ...
great !
<i>it always killed my father</ i> <i>that i was no good at sports . </ i>
<i>but he would never</ i> <i>tell me that . </ i>
my man !
it always killed me that you were no good at sports .
i' m sorry i flunked off the team , dad .
you' re not off the team yet .
what ?
lucky for you , your coach got you a make up quiz .
<i>damn ! </ i>
that' s what i' m talking about .
so , after dinner , go upstairs and study .
because if you don' t pass that quiz ,
i' m going to score 40 on your behind .
* everybody hates chris . *
hey .
oh , hi , swish .
good luck with the game .
hey , hey , wait .
i wasn' t trying to blow you off the other day .
then why did you ?
it was just that ...
it' s just i' m not cool ?
<i>i liked hanging out</ i> <i>with greg, </ i> <i>but a life without daily</ i> <i>ass whuppings</ i> <i>does have its appeal . </ i>
no , it' s not like that .
it' s just ... it' s kind of good to get a break .
all right .
i mean , i can' t blame you .
if i were you i' d probably do the same thing .
hey , i think i aced the quiz .
i know i failed it .
wait , but doesn' t that mean you can' t play ball ?
i wish .
coach brady found out and he got me a make up .
my mom made me study all night .
and if i don' t pass , she will kill me .
but if you do play everybody' s going to hate you .
not everybody .
just everybody on the team ... everybody who likes the team and everybody else .
all done .
<i>i decided to fail</ i> <i>the test on purpose . </ i>
<i>whatever my mother</ i> <i>might do to me, </ i> <i>at least it wasn' t 400 of her . </ i>
you passed .
what ? !
hold on , let me see this .
every answer on this paper is wrong .
you are on the basketball team , right ?
yeah , but what does that have to do with anything ?
good luck at the game , swish .
<i>another life secret </ i> <i>black man plus basketball</ i> <i>equals a c plus . </ i>
i passed .

i didn' t mean to bother you , but can i borrow some scotch tape and some ten pound test fishing line ?
fishing line ?
ten pound test .
we don' t have any fishing line , mr. tate .
maybe your husband does .
well , maybe i' il ask him when he gets home .
thank you , ma' am .
i' il come back down .
that man is not from philly .
swish .
i want to run you through a couple plays .
