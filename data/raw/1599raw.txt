chihiro .
chihiro .
we' re almost there .
this really is the middle of nowhere .
i' il have to shop in the next town .
it' il be great , once we get used to it .
look , there' s the school .
that' s your new school , chihiro .
it doesn' t look so bad .
i liked my old school ...
mommy ...
my flowers died !
no wonder , the way you clung to them .
a little water when we get there and they' il perk right up .
my very first bouquet is farewell flowers , how sad ..
what about that rose you got for your birthday ?
one rose isn' t a bouquet .
you dropped your card .
i' m opening the window .
c' mon now , behave yourself it' s a big day for all of us .
splrited away
hey ...
did i take the wrong turn ?
i don' t get it .
that must be it , look .
it must be that blue one over there .
that' s it .
i must' ve missed the turn off .
i bet this road will get us there .
this is always how you get us lost .
just a little farther , ok ?
what are those little houses ?
they' re shrines , people pray to them .
daddy , are we lost ?
we' re fine , we' ve got 4 wheel drive .
sit down , chihiro .
you' re going to kill us !
a tunnel ?
what' s this strange building ?
must be the way in .
honey ...
let' s go back , honey .
chihiro .
no ...
it' s just plaster .
this building' s pretty new .
the wind' s going in .
what is it ?
let' s have a look , there' s a way through .
it' s creepy , daddy , let' s go back .
no need to be scared .
just a little farther , ok ?
the moving van' il get there before us .
so , let ' em , they' ve got the keys let the movers move us .
i know , but ...
no !
i won' t go !
daddy , let' s go back .
nothing to be scared of .
i won' t go !
chihiro , you wait in the car .
mommy !
wait .
watch your step .
you' il make me trip , chihiro , clinging like that .
where are we ?
say , do you hear that ?
it' s a train !
maybe we' re near the station .
let' s go and find out .
what are those houses doing here ?
i knew it .
this must be an abandoned theme park .
they built so many in the early ' 90s ... ... but they all went down with the economy .
this must be one of ' em .
what !
even farther !
let' s go back .
daddy .
c' mon !
mommy , that building' s moaning .
it' s just the wind .
what a lovely spot .
we should' ve brought our lunch with us .
they were making a river .
hey , you smell that ?
see , it smells great .
you' re right .
maybe they' re still open .
hurry up , chihiro .
wait for me !
this way .
can you believe it , they' re all restaurants .
where is everybody ?
over there !
hey , hey !
in here , here .
how amazing !
hello , anybody here ?
come in , chihiro , it looks delicious .
hello !
oh , don' t worry we can pay them when they get back .
you' re right that one looks great ...
i wonder what this is called .
delicious !
chihiro , taste it !
i don' t want to !
let' s go !
they' re gonna be mad at us .
don' t worry . you' ve got daddy here .
i' ve got credit cards and cash .
take some .
chihiro .
it' s so tender .
mustard ..
thank you .
mommy !
daddy !
weird ...
there' s a train !
you' re not allowed here go back !
wha ... ?
it' s almost night !
leave before it gets dark !
they' re lighting the lamps , go !
i' il distract them , get back across the river !
what' s his problem ?
daddy !
daddy , let' s go home .
let' s go , daddy !
daddy !
mommy !
mommy !
it' s water !
this can' t be ...
i' m dreaming , dreaming !
wake up !
wake up !
wake ... up ...
it' s just a dream , a dream .
go away , disappear .
disappear .
i can see through !
it' s a dream , it' s got to be .
don' t be afraid , i' m a friend .
no , no , no !
open your mouth and eat this .
unless you eat something from this world , you' il vanish .
no !
don' t worry , it won' t turn you into a pig .
chew it and swallow .
good girl , you' re fine .
see for yourself .
i' m back again ...
you see ?
now come .
what about my mom and dad ?
they didn' t really turn into pigs , did they ?
you can' t see them now , but you will .
quiet !
it' s looking for you .
there' s no time , let' s run !
i ...
i can' t stand !
oh , no !
my legs don' t work .
calm , now , take a deep breath .
in the name of the wind and the water within thee ...
unbind her .
get up !
hold your breath while we' re on the bridge .
even a tiny breath .. .. will break the spell and the attendants will see you .
i' m scared .
be calm .
welcome , always nice to see you .
welcome , welcome .
i' m back from my task .
welcome back , sir .
a deep breath ...
and hold ...
welcome back !
we missed you !
hang on , we' re almost ...
master haku !
where have you ...
wha ...
a human ?
run !
what ...
master haku , master haku !
chase after it , a human intruder !
i smell humans !
the stench of humans !
they know you' re here .
i' m sorry , i took a breath .
no , chihiro , you did very well .
listen and i' il tell you what to do .
stay here , and they' il find you .
i' il distract them .
in the meantime , you escape .
no , don' t go !
stay with me , please .
you have no choice , if you want to survive here .
and save your parents , too .
so they did turn into pigs ...
i wasn' t dreaming ...
be still ...
when things quiet down , go out by the back gate .
take the stairs , all the way down .
until you reach the boiler room , where they stoke the fires .
kamaji' s there , so look for him .
kamaji ?
ask him for work .
even if he rejects you , persist .
if you don' t work , yubaba will turn you into an animal .
yubaba ?
you' il see .
she' s the sorceress who rules our world .
kamaji will turn you away , trick you into you leaving .
but keep on asking him for work .
it' il be hard work , but it will give you a chance .
then even yubaba can' t harm you .
ok
master haku , master haku !
i have to go .
remember , chihiro , i' m your friend .
how do you know my name ?
i' ve known you since you were small .
my name is haku .
here i am !
master haku .
yubaba wants you .
i know , it' s about my task .
um ...
excuse me .
um ...
um , are you kamaji ?
um , haku sent me here .
please let me work here .
darn , all at once ...
get to work , you little runts !
i' m ...
kamaji .
slave to the boilers that heat the baths .
step on it , boys !
um , please let me work here !
i' ve got all the help i need .
the place is full of soot .
plenty of replacements .
oh , i' m sorry .
please wait .
outta the way !
um ...
what should i do with this ?
do i just leave it ?
finish what you start !
it' s hot !
hey , you runts !
wanna turn back into soot ?
and you , watch it .
you can' t just take someone' s job .
if they don' t work , the spell wears off .
got no work for you here .
look elsewhere .
you sootballs got a problem ? !
get to work !
to work !
chow time .
what ?

cut it out .
where' s your bowl ?
i keep telling you to leave it out .
meal time !
take a break !
a human !
you' re in trouble !
they' re having a fit about it upstairs .
that' s my granddaughter .
granddaughter ! ?
says she wants to work , but i' ve got all the help i need .
would you take her to yubaba ?
the girl can handle her , i' m sure .
not a chance !
and risk my life ! ?
take this , then , a roasted newt .
real quality .
if you want to work , you' il have to make a deal with yubaba .
might as well try your luck .
fine !
you there , follow me .
can' t you even manage a " yes ma' am , " or " thank you " ?
yes ...
yes ma' am .
you sure are slow .
hurry !
yes ma' am .
what do you need shoes for !
or socks !
yes ma' am !
did you even thank kamaji ?
he' s looking out for you .
thank you very much , sir .
good luck !
yubaba lives way up at the top , in the back .
get over here !
you wanna lose your nose ?
we' re almost there .
right .
here we are .
wel ...
welcome !
this elevator is not in service , sir , please use another .
he' s following us ...
quit gawking .
here we are .
your room is on the right .
lin ?
yes !
what' s that smell ?
it' s human .
you reek of human .
is that so ?
i smell it , i do ..
smells mighty tasty , too .
you' re hiding something .
tell me the truth , now .
this smell ?
roasted ...
gimme !
not a chance , it' s for the other girls .
i' m begging you , i' il settle for a leg !
anyone going up , pull down on the lever .
not going to knock ? !
what a puny little girl .
come closer ...
i said closer .
ouch ...
you' re making a racket , keep it down .
um ...
please let me work here .
stop babbling .
you' re just a useless weakling .
besides , this is no place for humans .
it' s a bath house ,
where 8 million gods can rest their weary bones .
your parents had some nerve !
gobbling our guests ' food like pigs !
just desserts , i' d say .
and you' il never see ... ... your world again either .
you' d make a lovely piglet .
or maybe a lump of coal .
i see you' re trembling .
actually , i' m impressed you made it this far .
someone must' ve helped you .. .. i must thank your friend .
just who was it , my dear ?
you can tell me .
please let me work here !
not that again !
i want to work here !
shut up !
why should i hire you ?
anyone can see you' re a lazy , spoiled , crybaby .
stupid to boot .
i' ve nothing for you .
forget it .
i' ve got all the bums i need around here .
or maybe you' d like the worst , nastiest job i' ve got , until you breathe your very last breath !
stop that !
what' s wrong ...
i' il be right there !
that' s a good baby , now .
what ?
you still here !
get out !
i want to work here !
don' t shout !
i' il be right there ...
that' s a good baby .
there , there ..
please let me work !
ok , ok , just pipe down .
there , there , now .
your contract .
sign your name .
i' il put you to work .
but one peep out of you about anything , and i' il turn you right into a piglet !
um , i sign my name here ?
that' s right .
quit dilly dallying and do it .
unbelievable .
that ridiculous oath i took .
to give work to whoever asks .
signed it ?

what an extravagant name .
from now on , you' il be sen.

even on yubaba' s orders ...
we can' t allow humans .
her contract' s signed .
what ... ?
thank you , everyone .
don' t send her to us , can' t bear that human stink .
three days of eating our food and her smell will vanish .
if she' s still useless then , fry her , boil her , do with her as you will .
back to work !
where' s lin ?
don' t dump her on me !
you wanted help .
that' s right , lin' s just perfect .
go , sen.
yes , sir .
what a pain .
you' re gonna pay for this .
off you go !
c' mon .
so you pulled it off , huh ? !
you' re so thick , i was worried .
keep your wits , now if you need something , ask me , ok ?
what' s wrong .
i' m dizzy .
so this is our room .
chow , then bed , you' il be fine .
you wash your own apron !
trousers !
you' re so puny .
too big ...
um , lin ...
what ?
are there two hakus here ?
two ? !
of him ?
i sure hope not .
still too big .
he' s yubaba' s henchman , watch out for him .
where the ...
here they are .
what' s wrong ?
are you ok ?
what' s all the fuss , lin ?
new girl , says she feels faint .
meet me at the bridge .

thank you .
follow me .
daddy , mommy , it' s me !
it' s sen.
mommy , daddy !
are they sick or hurt ?
no , they ate too much .
sleeping it off .
they don' t even remember being human .
daddy , mommy , i promise i' il save you !
don' t get too fat , or they' il eat you !
hide these .
i thought they were gone .
you' il need them when you get home .
this was a farewell card ...
chi hi ro .
chihiro ...
that' s my name .
yubaba rules others by stealing their names .
you' re sen here , but keep your real name a secret .
she almost got mine , i' d nearly turned into sen.
if she steals your name , you' il never find your way home .
i no longer remember mine .
your real name ?
but it' s strange i remembered yours .
go ahead , eat , you must be hungry .
i don' t want to .
i put a spell on it to give you back your strength , eat it .
you' ve had a hard time , eat some more .
can you find your way back ?
yes , haku , thank you .
i' il work very hard .
good .

i was worried .
i' m sorry .

orders from the top .
better give it your all .
aren' t you ... getting wet ?
hurry up , sen !
coming !
i' il leave this open .
on the big tub , lin ?
lay off me .
jerks !
they haven' t scrubbed this in ages !
this bath is reserved for our filthiest guests .
it' s caked with sludge .
lin , sen , first customers are here .

clearly harassment .
this tub needs an herbal soak .
get a tag from the foreman .
a tag ?
an herbal soak tag .

feeling refreshed ?
for kasuga sama .
one deluxe sulfur soak .
no point in standing there .
back to work !
scrub with your hands .
good morning .

oh ...
a fragrant bath coming up relax and enjoy ...
hello , foreman here .
