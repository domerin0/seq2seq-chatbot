how does a girl who falls no , actually , she jumps ... ... eyes open , down a rabbit hole , plummeting into chaos ... ... come out the other end unchanged ?
the answer ?
she doesn' t .
see , i know , because that girl is me .
but to truly understand the predicament i was in ... ... i . e . , stuck in the middle of chaos ... ... you' d have to go back to that first day at my new job .
actually , to be fair , you should go back a little further ... ... starting with mom .
don' t worry .
i' m not blaming her ... ... entirely .
she believed that all problems could be solved by listening to carly simon .
greatest hits .
side two .
hurry .
something about her voice , or her lyrics , or her music ... ... helped mom clear the chaos ... ... especially after a fight with dad .
or when he left us for good .
people said mom was better off .
they said she was lucky .
but she believed ....
luck is when preparation meets opportunity .
you gotta prepare for the life you want .
and though i knew i wanted a career in broadcast journalism ... ... it took a little carly and a lot of time ... ... to find the person i most wanted to work with .
she is smart and she is learning .
diane sawyer .
chic , smart , intelligent  and she married well .
good point .
she' s a little beige .
no , no , she' s taupe .
taupe is never beige .
taupe' s classic .
confident .
it says , " i' m elegant .
" and i don' t need color to prove it .
there you go .
i wanna work with her one day .
you should work with her .
i will work with her .
with my career decided , i left for college ... ... hopeful i would meet someone i could be certain of .
phillip .
bruce .
jeremy .
noah .
trotsky .
frank .
bean .
bean ?
as in , " how have you ... ?
bean .
yeah .
i really , really like him , mom .
you do ?
yeah , i do .
i think i do .
maybe .
don' t over commit yourself unless you are absolutely certain .
you' ve gotta prepare for the life you want .
again , i turned to carly .
and while my roommates weren' t as understanding as i' d hoped ...
come back to bed . ... it did bring certainty .
i' m sorry , bean .
we have only but one road to travel in this life .
and i just don' t think we' re on the same one .
so to get more involved , or for me to over commit myself ... ... would just lead to chaos .
how do you know ?
i' m certain .
i mean , what if you' re wrong ?
what if we' re supposed to be together ?
what if you just made the biggest mistake of your life ?
stacy , honey !
smile !
stacy , honey !
smile !
there are moments in life where you hope your decisions weren' t rash .
bean !
bean !
and moments where you just know .
stacy .
derek .
nice to meet you .
yeah , ditto .
i had met my life mate .
i was certain .
yeah !
yes !
that' s good .
yes ?
the bar' s closed .
what are you doing ?
that first year of our relationship was amazing .
we were in sync , inseparable ... ... and in love .
and though i technically still lived with mom ... ... i was spending practically all my time at derek' s .
my life was going according to plan .
sort of .
derek !
bob !
bob !
professionally speaking , i was the go to girl in a dead end job .
i mean , you can only work your way up for so long , right ?
it was time to move on .
and while diane sawyer was still out of reach ... ... television personality kippie kann wasn' t .
the grande dame of daytime talk needed an associate producer .
me .
it was a match made in trenton .
which brings us up to speed .
lra nachlis .

katie , you wanna show them the ?
take a look at our new look .
" kippie kann keeps competitors ....
he' s bringing back the hard k' s .
keep going , katie .
keep it going .
it was her thing , like a trademark . " creatively while keeping keen " ....
but that was a million years ago .
nostalgia , folks .
hearkens back to a simpler time .
they eat it up .
like when captain kangaroo was king and casey kasem was in kindergarten .
he' s nuts .
who invented reality ?
we did .
so keep those hard k' s coming .
kipp , you should be in makeup , kiddo .
cut the k' s , carl .
it' s cute .
it' s kippie .
it' s crap !
capisce ?
that orchid on the desk ?
well , i just got it .
which can only mean it' s a new picture .
let me see that .
she' s right .
this cruelty cannot continue .
katie .
carl .
lf somebody has a problem with me ...
... just tell me straight up .
otherwise  you get canned .
with a " c.
kippie , to makeup .
good girl .
i told you .
i' il do my best to catch the culprit , kippie .
thank you ....
ira .
nachlis .
nice to meet you .
i' ve worked here for three years .
okay , people , need you focused right here !
it' s all about sweeps .
give me drama , pathos , life unfolding .
make me cry .
ira .
regurgitate something fresh .
" midget holiday hell .
stinks .
come on .
give it to daddy .
" parents who party .
who do they party with ?
rejecting the midgets ?
midgets .
what ?
mixed parents .
happy mixed parents .
one normal size ....
one midget ?
sexy .
i like it .
those midgets are mine !
you can' t corner the midget market !
yours party during holidays .
mine party as a family .
are they happy ?
it' d make you cry .
kippie is great with sentiment .
give me that thing !
don' t !
don' t touch me !
he has no happy midgets !
gentlemen , please !
we combine the segments .
we share the credit and the midgets .
we work together here , people .
we are a team .
" grandma' s a hooker .
you got a grandma ?
several .
run the prep .
" penitentiary porn .
" little black books .
do not follow .
electronic little black books .
as in ?
as in palms ... ... blackberries , desk organizers .
electronic footprints ... ... of where your man has been and with whom .
under the right circumstances , they could be a girl' s best friend .
especially a scorned girlfriend , wife , mistress
i think it' s a fantastic idea .
thank you !
since our audience is 90 % female  sexy !
run the prep .
let' s go !
come on .
" pregnant strippers " !
" black midgets with books " !
" unnatural animal love .
" literacy in lnner city schools .
shit !
take it back .
take it back .
she was just kidding .
and i tried to pretend i was .
first the doorbell , then the staff meeting ?
i am absolutely mortified .
don' t worry , no one will remember .
you can ring my bell hey , stop it !
ring my bell she' s really upset .
oh , please .
i' m the only victim here .
why should i be forced to share credit with ?
not fair .
your midget idea was tired .
his twist made it different .
thanks , i feel so much better .
if you make sweeps even with shared credit , that' s a huge deal .
i happen to know that the people from harpo , oprah' s group ... ... tivo every one of our shows .
for what it' s worth , i really like your " little black book " idea .
really ?
yeah .
so don' t cry in my soup .
so how does it all work exactly ?
you put your best shows in sweeps .
the most outrageous , the most provocative attention grabbers .
then they promo it .
it' s about getting eyeballs ... ... to get numbers , to get revenue , to get renewed .
we' re beginning sweeps now , so things are in the can .
so , what was pitched today ?
june sluts .
slots .
of which we average nine a month .
we " being the drones .
the aps .
when an ap gets a slut slot .
it' s like a credit .
you need so many credits to advance .
and you have the most ?
catching on .
he' s next .
the only way to jump ahead of him is if you land the live show .
please .
this month ?
a week from friday .
aps never get the live show .
karen meskil .
urban legend .
anyway , if you do , you' re instantly promoted .
wow .
hi , barbara .
hey , kippie .
great show .
let' s not go there .
you must be stacy .
wow .
i am so unbelievably sorry about what happened .
please .
let he who is without sin cast the first stone .
hello again .
ira .
nachlis .
yes , you are .
so sorry to hear about you and neil .
i thought he was a keeper .
kippie ?
sorry .
excuse me .
bye .
who' s neil ?
my boyfriend .
ex , actually .
hi , barbara .
how' s neil ?
you must be stacy .
what' s missing here ?
oh , me !
you' re right .
i should get as many shows on the air as possible .
be seen .
noticed by somebody .
anybody .
okay , so , what i' m about to do should not be interpreted as groveling ... ... hypocrisy , or desperation .
it' s merely a loss of personal integrity .
excuse me .
larry , wait up !
he' s funny .
yeah .
talented too .
okay , i' il do the midgets .
too bad he' il never make it here .
why not ?
he cares too much what everyone thinks .
especially kippie .
and that' s bad because ... ?
they' re shopping for a newer model .
but she' s the boss .
it' s been in the works a long time .
who do you think leaked the pictures to the tabloids ?
her ratings are down , and she' s got five years left on her contract .
you do the math .
so is it always like this ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t been here long enough to say .
no , i thought you were  a lifer ?
no .
a year and a half ago i was on wall street .
and before that i drove a bus .
it' s all pretty much the same .
people will tell you who they are if you just listen .
you can figure them out .
sometimes you can help .
let' s help kippie .
i should warn you .
i' m uncomfortable with touching and sentiment .
sorry .
thank you .
it' s all about the bottom line .
ln every business .
does she know ?
she used to be prime time out of new york .
now she' s syndicated in jersey .
it' s one thing to start here , but you don' t climb your way to trenton .
nothing we can do , short of winning sweeps .
well , then let' s win sweeps .
oh , okay .
we could try .
win one for the kipper ?
please .
this is too earnest for me .
you' ve been teetering , and you just crossed over .
don' t you like her ?
i do , actually .
a lot .
but that' s irrelevant .
that may be so , but does it reveal who your true friends are ?
are they keeping secrets ?
well , it' s not a secret anymore for someone ... ... and we' il tell you why after these words .
hey !
man , you should have seen what came out of this animal .
i miss all the good stuff .
think you' re pretty cute , don' t you ?
well , i' m no bob .
you better apologize .
i think you just insulted bob .
you insinuated ugliness .
i did not .
i did not .
apologize .
okay , okay !
i' m sorry , bob .
i' m sorry .
wait .
where are you going ?
i gotta finish packing .
two minutes .
did i tell you about nieuwendyk' s cousin ?
mvp out of detroit ?
guess who he' s seeing friday morning .
his request .
yeah , you told me .
it' s amazing .
honey , this fast forward thing isn' t working .
oh , my god !
what ?
oh , it' s the gas .
oh , god !
bob , get down .
come here , boy .
open a window .
honey ....
yeah , plus robbie moore , out of buffalo ?
these guys are , like , the top two recruits in the country .
and if i can nail them both ....
no ifs .
you will .
i know it .
oh , what is the matter with that bob ?
burrito .
want me to take him out ?
later .
i can do it right now .
no .
positive ?
jesus wept !
bob !
no more hot sauce , all right ?
why are you feeding him hot sauce ?
i don' t know .
what are you watching ?
oh , kippie .
i' m studying the format .
tell us how bulimia ...
... affected your relationships , lulu .
i lost them all .
my agent .
my friends .
my boyfriends .
lulu ?
fritz .
the supermodel .
i was so ashamed .
i knew it .
i knew she barfed .
oh , that documentary .
no , i mean i heard her .
you heard lulu fritz barfing ?
yeah , couple times .
nasty .
you think i' m gonna need a sweater in detroit ?
in may ?
what ?
you don' t feel compelled to explain further ?
we dated .
a little .
i told you that , didn' t l ?
let me think .
no .
thought i did .
are you gonna be cool staying here by yourself ?
you' il walk bob ?
sure .
don' t let him walk you .
who' s the boss ?
me .
tell him that .
i' m the boss , bob .
you hear that , bob ?
you never mentioned her .
who ?
lulu .
because we don' t sit around talking about past relationships .
she was a relationship .
come on , stace .
yeah , we do .
you told me about that med student you dated right before me .
and then the girl before that .
what' s her name ?
joyce .
i guess you just forgot to mention  this is why i hate talking about this .
it' s just , you end up fighting over old ghosts .
it' s history .
it' s over .
the past is past .
that' s before the past was a supermodel that barfed quietly .
you know , i don' t pry into your old boyfriends .
i never dated brad pitt .
all right .
shut it off , okay ?
look , i' ve had really bad experiences ... ... talking about past relationships , no matter how casual .
if you have to know , we had problems in bed .
hallelujah
okay ?
okay .
bob hates it when we fight .
we' re not fighting .
tell him .
we are not fighting , bob .
so no more lulu fritz ?
i will never mention the name " lulu fritz " again .
lulu fritz .
no .
lulu fritz .
no .
and he never told you ?
the past is past .
" unnatural animal love " in five .
tell me you' re not quoting him .
we made an agreement not to discuss old relationships .
renegotiate .
no .
those who do not learn from his history are condemned to repeat it .
doesn' t matter who he dated .
what matters is why he stopped .
what' s he do ?
he works for the devils .
who doesn' t ?
kidding .
think about it hypothetically .
say derek' s like neil .
hypothetically .
how do you find out before you' re too far gone ?
i was screwing my way through the phone book .
" and i only got to k.
" the past is past .
right .
your man' s hiding something .
what about his family ?
good point .
they' il always give dirt .
no , that' s not what i mean .
what are they like ?
you can tell a lot by studying where he came from .
i haven' t met them .
he doesn' t bring girls home .
he just doesn' t .
can i ask ... ... you ever think of appealing this decision ?
meeting the folks ?
i don' t wanna make him feel uncomfortable .
yeah .
let' s not do that .
that' d be bad .
stop it !
what century are you in ?
you have a right nay , an obligation to find out more .
he' s away for , what , two weeks ?
take that time , i beg you .
learn a few things .
anything .
information' s power .
feels dishonest .
that' s because it is .
you wanna keep your man , you find out why they didn' t .
i thought you stopped .
i have .
look , i agree .
there' s better ways to do it .
it' d be great if you could ask him  or the folks .
since no one argues with the lord and master , you gotta get creative .
all men should come with letters of recommendation , or warning labels .
or little black books .
does he have one ?
a palm .
why ?
she may be hopeless .
she' s not hopeless .
okay , then open it up .
explore .
speaking of which , what was lulu' s last name ?
fritz .
why ?
what' s that ?
vintage .
working girl , 1 988 .
good movie ?
it' s a great movie .
you' ve never seen it ?
staten lsland girl trying to make her way in the big city ...
... on her own terms .
melanie griffith , huh ?
yeah .
has she never heard of call waiting ?
and mike nichols .
he' s famous .
he' s a genius .
plus , he' s married to diane sawyer .
who you wanna be .
ringing !
ladies .
i don' t wanna be her , barb .
i wanna work with her .
i will work with her .
i believe i will .
i believe you will too .
hello , lulu fritz ?
ira nachlis .
senior associate producer/ producer , kippie kann do .
listen , " i model , then i barf quietly " ...
... is one of our highest rated shows .
what are you doing ?
i am trying to give a young innocent her 1 5 minutes of fame .
now
i' m sorry .
lulu ... ... we' re thinking of having a special next month .
we' d like you to come in tomorrow for an interview .
excellent .
we' il do lunch and throw up catch up .
i would love to expose myself to your viewers .
okay .
not going there .
so how did the documentary affect your personal life , lulu ?
well , it forced stephen , my ex , to face his truth .
he barfed too .
fascinating .
and before stephen ?
i didn' t date much .
i was shy .
and ugly .
why do supermodels say how ugly they were when they were young ?
is it because they want us to know they suffered ?
do they think that it makes them more deserving ?
that we' il forgive them their bounty ?
none of us believe you .
no one invited me to the prom .
makes you stronger .
so the only relationship you ever had ever was stephen ?
no .
i mean , i dated a few people .
names , please .
fabrizio .
renato .
carmine .
jahni .
derek .
she said his name .
derek .
his name came out of that mouth .
derek .
derek .
her " derek " was my derek .
but mostly i was lonely .
how sad .
tell me about one of the early guys .
oh , say , derek .
derek ?
it was just a casual kind of thing .
stace , let her tell the story .
i am .
she is .
go ahead .
i was so young .
i can hardly remember .
happens to all of us .
it was all superficial .
what isn' t these days ?
completely about sex .
completely about what ?
sex .
sex .
sex .
but you had problems in bed ?
you don' t know that .
guessing !
someone needs to chill .
actually , the bedroom ... ... was the only place we really connected .
two , sometimes three times a day .
funny how your memory just snapped back like that .
anyways , derek and i didn' t talk much .
i just used him for
we know .
pretty amazing .
experimental .
wild .
sounds great .
why' d you split ?
oh , same old , same old .
schedules .
travel .
temptation .
he cheated .
no !
i did .
all the time .
but he stuck around like a lovesick puppy .
finally , i asked him to go back to his old girlfriend .
she called all the time , begging him , pleading .
she was desperate .
joyce ?
how' d you know her name ?
you mentioned it .
she mentioned it .
you did .
i did ?
yeah .
well , joyce .
he only went back to her out of pity .
i wonder what he' s doing now .
hey , derek .
this is lulu !
hey , derek .
this is lulu !
just thought i' d give you a call and let you know i was in town .
cow .
quietly barfing cow .
and suddenly , my certain world didn' t seem so certain after all .
hi , bob .
are you hungry ?
i' m not hungry .
lulu dangled before me like bait on a wire .
i swallowed it whole ... ... and then wanted more .
it was time for the past to meet the present .
bob , look .
a box .
i just need to clean up some stuff .
he told me to .
just checking things out , you know ?
oh , look .
pictures .
so this is hysterical joyce .
you don' t look so desperate .
you look athletic .
and pretty .
where was this taken ?
new york city marathon .
okay .
where you crossed the finish line .
and you were crying .
and so was derek while he hugs you .
there' s so many neat pictures , bob .
rachel keyes .
you are a podiatrist , i think ?
what' s with that little minx like smile ?
what ?
can you just not look at me like that , please ?
it' s making me very uncomfortable .
there .
see ?
i' m done .
okay ?
and don' t judge me .
okay , bob ?
hey , stacy , it' s me .
you there ?
okay , i guess you' re out with bob .
listen , i left my palm at home .
i need you to go through it and get me some numbers .
take care .
palm ?
did you hear that , bob ?
derek left his palm at home .
guess we' il have to look for it .
if i were a palm , where would i be ?
if we were palms , where would we be , bob ?
where is it ?
where could it be right now ?
he asked for it .
where could it be ?
luck is when preparation meets opportunity .
okay , bob ?
life' s about certainty .
it' s about being in control .
password , password , password .
what would his password be ?
thank you .
what ?
go to your bed .
go to your bed , bob !
seconds before opening the metallic case ... ... i envisioned all the evil flowing into the world .
i was pandora .
and then i got over it .
look at that .
joyce works at the kaleidoscope kitchen .
brand new place .
know what that means ?
it' s a new entry .
that place has only been open two , three months .
how would he know that unless they still talk ?
that' s ridiculous .
ladies .
hey !
we could give her a little jingle .
" hello , joyce ...
where' s leo ?
where' s leo ? ... moore ?
we' re doing research on an upcoming episode ... ... ' best chefs in the tri state area . '
no guarantees , of course , but i was wondering if we could ... ... spend a little time ...
... getting to know each other better .
not doing it .
now , how about that doctor he dated ?
what was her name ?
barb .
you have to admit it' s educational .
look what you learned with lulu .
he didn' t cheat .
i never thought he did .
he said they had problems in bed ... ... and it turns out the problem was getting out .
little lie .
harmless .
unless it' s a pattern .
it' s not a pattern .
how do you know ?
say , hypothetically , you get a dog .
a what ?
a dog , hypothetically .
and you find out his grandfather and father chased cars .
whose father ?
the dog' s .
in fact ... ... all the males in his line , car chasers .
chances are he' il chase cars .
helpful information you can only get by doing research .
you need to find out , is your man a car chaser ?
no .
are you sure ?
people are creatures of habit .
last one .
their behavior is patterned .
after neil slept with half of newark , i found out he' d been doing it for years .
so keep yourself dumb and believe what he tells you , or ....
up to you .
god , i hate this .
i know .
i hate doubt .
you' il get over it .
now , what was the name of that chiropractor ?
podiatrist .
dr. rachel keyes .
barb ?
yeah ?
look , make an appointment .
that' s all .
see how you feel once you meet her .
if you don' t do the whole kippie spiel , at least your feet will be happy .
you wanna work with diane sawyer ?
you gotta learn how to do research .
in the field .
health and wellness women' s clinic .
hold , please .
look under the hood before you purchase the car .

would you take a look at that cervix , nurse kisilevsky ?
textbook .
i' m not the first person who' s told you that , i' m sure .
can' t hear it enough .
it was all too horrible .
i had to avert my eyes .
which made me focus on a sight more horrific .
midst what seemed like an unusual amount of dr. keyes ' beauty shots ... ... stood a picture that jumped out .
big .
dr. rachel keyes and bob ?
stinky bob !
why would she have a picture with him unless he was hers ?
worse , theirs .
i needed to take control .
fast !
dr. keyes , i work with the kippie kann show .

call me rachel .
i started the vitamin company about a year and a half ago .
it' s just taken off .
oh ?

your picture' s on it .
i fought them on that .

so tell me , rachel .
what did you have to sacrifice to get here ?
relationships ?
family ?
pets ?
i never wanted to settle in order to settle down .
you know what i' m talking about .
oh , yeah .
back to pets .
i noticed a picture of a dog in the examination room .
so happy looking .
bob .
he' s my ex' s dog , but i raised him .
he was such a cuddler .
your ex ?
the dog .
i could' ve lobbied to keep him when we split .
but med school by day , the book by night .

yeah , he' s with derek .
my ex .
but i have visitation rights .
oh , really ?

the photograph in the exam room was taken a few weeks ago at a picnic .

the only salient information you need to know is , did he cheat ?

it' s just that he saw her a few weeks ago .
they picnicked , which is totally fine .

lf it turns into a pizza , i' m getting one .
take that thing out of your pants .
oh , wow .
so joyce has freckles , huh ?

and she' s not self conscious .
so many women hide their bodies these days , but not her .

jackpot .
look at that arrow .

mom , dad , joyce .
hawaii , ' 99 " ?

presenting joyce moore and her cheesy music .

barbara ....
trying .
trying .
please make it stop .
oh , great .
now it' s frozen .
hey , if you can do better ....
later .
listen .
here' s the thing .
if you' re happy with what you know ... ... do you deserve explanation about what you don' t ?
i mean , hypothetically , you are in this great relationship with neil .
that' s his name , right ?
it wasn' t a good relationship with neil .
hypothetically .
you get married .
you have kids .
you' re totally and completely fulfilled .
then neil dies .
where' s that dial tone coming from ?
i don' t know .
does he die tragically ?
okay .
then you find out he cheated .
that he had this whole other life .
now , does that detract from what you two had together ?
does it make it all a lie ?
yes .
why ?
because omissions are betrayals .
omissions are ....
betrayals .
they are betrayals .
ls that your cell ?
mine whistles .
hey , there .
it' s joyce moore .
do the deed after the beep .
what ?
the computer called joyce ?
what did you do ?
nothing !
i was standing over here .
hey , you got derek' s machine .
you know what to do and when to do it .
derek , you there ?
it' s joyce .
my caller id said you just phoned .
why did you hang up ?
i' ve been waiting for you to call since last week .
what ?
okay .
give me a holler .
if i' m not home , try my cell .
by the way , everyone loved your joke .
bye .
his joke ?
what joke ?
derek doesn' t joke .
nobody thinks he' s funny .
he' s not funny .
what does this mean ?
i think it means she' s not history .
is it always like this here ?
hey , you got derek' s machine .
you know what to do and when to do it .
it' s derek .
he' s checking the messages .
he' s going to hear joyce .
erase it !
smash it !
do something !
how ?
what am i going to do ?
kill it .
okay .
okay !
derek
good !
there !
yeah !
what ?
i' ve just smashed an answering machine with a hockey stick .
damn proud of you !
there were numbers on that machine that he needed , and i ....
i' ve just smashed it .
i smashed the hell out of it .
god' s punishing me .
i hear you , god .
you can stop now .
what has happened to me ?
you' ve discovered truth .
i' ve discovered a whole other reality .
they all talk .
dr. keyes and derek .
joyce and derek ?
maybe they all talk to each other .
maybe it' s just me they don' t talk to .
bottom line is , he' s withheld .
i' m gonna find out what' s going on .
good !
why she was waiting for his call .
good question .
lf he still sees her , why don' t i know ?
better question .
and if he has nothing to hide , why hide these old relationships ?
want me to write these down for you ?
so i guess i need to know ... ... what i don' t know .
i just need to .

i' m who ?
my ex .
i told you about him .
he works for the devils .
we' il meet him after the game for a drink .
it' s a ritual .
oh , really ?
the beautiful people have arrived .

i better call the manager and make sure the camera crew is cleared .
so we' re on ?
great .
call me .
you have my number ?
yep .
okay , good .
those are manolos , you clumsy
joyce .
if i were you , i wouldn' t finish that statement .
stacy ?
lulu !
get a shot of us .
she produces the kippie kann show .
why is she calling you stacy , barb ?
that' s her name .
no , actually , my name is barb .
the other woman you met' s name is stacy .
no ?
yes .
she was barb .
no .
no what ?
enjoy your meal .
join us , stacy barb ?
okay , phillip .
bring your camera .
how do you know her ?
we did a show last year on bulimia .
oh , why am i not surprised ?
she does make you wanna throw up .
or at least me .
sorry , i don' t really like her , i guess .
" i guess " ?
she used to hang out with my brother , and i sort of took her under my wing ... ... until she took derek from under mine .
he cheated on you with her ?
no , we had split up .
but one day we' re talking about getting married ... ... and the next day we' re dating other people .
taking space .
god , i hate that expression , don' t you ?
hate it .
so then ?
so then he starts talking to lulu , who totally knows the score .
and then she advises me to see other people .
hideous .
and she meant nothing to him .
she was a fling .
i mean , he wanted us to get back together .
but , in a way , we' re just closer being friends .
you are ?
good .
you are .
we are , and if not , there' s always the boomerangs .
the boomerangs .
yeah .
you know the kind .
you throw them out there into the world ....
and they always come back to you .
yeah , that' s right .
he bought us each one , and we promised never to throw them away .
so no matter what happened , if we needed to , or wanted to ...
... then we could still end up ....
together .
anyway , whatever .
why were we talking about this ?
you know , he probably wouldn' t even remember the story ... ... never mind the boomerangs , and then there' s me , the romantic sap ... ... who still has hers framed in the bedroom .
how stupid is that ?
not stupid .
it' s just a waste of energy .
there' s so many other interesting guys out there for you .
joyce , you' re gonna meet the right person .
watch .
or i could end up with derek .
wouldn' t that be funny ?
right now i' m not rushing into anything or anyone .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice ....
shame on me .
exactly .
something about the way she believed she might get him back ... ... made me believe it too .
thanks , pal .
hey !

a mouse .
a mouse did this ?
yeah .
there was a mouse , and , you know , bob freaked ...
... and forget about it .
a mouse scared bob ?
went crazy .
you wouldn' t believe it .
he chased him onto the answering machine ... ... where the mouse just , like , taunted and taunted bob .
so i ran and i got your stick , your hockey stick ... ... and i just smashed it .
you smashed a mouse ?
yeah .
no , like i would smash a mouse .
he got away , but i scared him good .
i don' t think he' il be coming back .
he carry my box down too ?
that' s very funny .
no , i did .
i was looking for another phone .
which you found , in a closed box marked " personal stuff .
no offense , derek , but you' re not exactly mr. organized .
you' re a mess .
all right , all right .
don' t go criticizing homie .
homie just got home .
yo , i was defending your dog , yo .
thank you .

very needy .
oh , yeah ?
he missed you .
he the only one ?
no , joyce missed you too .
so you wanna know why i' m home early ?
i' m seeing robbie moore' s parents tomorrow .
that means you' re close .
bringing the contract .
wait , wait .

i can' t miss the opportunity .

i' m sorry , bob .
all of us .
i felt like a lying sack of fertilizer .
knowing what i knew and not knowing what i didn' t ... ... and knowing more than anything that i had to know more .
she called all the time , begging him , pleading , pathetic .
she called all the time , begging him , pleading , pathetic .
he played me the messages on the machine .
they were hysterical .
she was desperate .
one angry chef , coming up .
i can' t show her that .
i' d be purposely hurting a friend .
knowledge is a terrible and a marvelous thing .
it just depends on your perspective .
think of it this way .
if she knew who you really were , she' d hate you .
can you blame her ?
and , stace ?
she' s not your friend .
have fun at the game .
hi , i' m sorry i' m late .
i was in the middle of a crisis with derek .
i' m helping him with something .
doesn' t he have someone else to help , like a girlfriend ?
probably a bunch .
but ....
we agreed not to discuss anyone we date , unless one of us was serious .
then we have to , but he' s not , and i' m not .
so why torture each other ?
you know , it' s just too painful for both of us .
sorry , that' s my cell .
hello ?
hey , i was just talking about you .
derek .
so , what happened ?
you might think it odd that i didn' t strangle her ... ... as i watched her flirt and coo with my man .
but i didn' t .
i was strangely drawn to their banter .
curious about this part of his life ... ... that i had been completely dumb to just a few days earlier .
they had a past .
they had a present separate from me .
they scored .
listen .
can you hear ?
she didn' t know he had a girlfriend , but she didn' t want to .
suddenly , i knew what i had to do .
finally i asked him to go back to his old girlfriend .
finally i asked him to go back to his old girlfriend .
she called all the time , begging him , pleading .
she was desperate .
joyce ?
how' d you know her name ?
you mentioned it .
you did .
she did .
i did ?
well , yes .
joyce .
he only went back to her out of pity .
barb was right .
as soon as joyce realized that he' d lied to her about lulu ... ... she' d never forgive him .
which was , after all , what i' d wanted .
so why did i feel so bad ?
i shouldn' t have shown you that .
no , i appreciate it , really .
it' s just so bad , you know .
i probably did call him a few times when he was with her .
but i was upset .
i wouldn' t characterize it as being hysterical or pathetic .
but for her to know ... ... that i called means that he told her .
even if she didn' t hear it , she knew , and that' s just so bad .
joyce , i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
he' s in there .
where ?
right there , with the orange sweater and the stupid haircut .
it is stupid .
yeah .
we stood there ... ... both of us sadly in love with the same man .
both of us feeling let down by him .
where are you going ?
i' m going home .
i' il see you tomorrow for the pre interview .
good night , barb .
wait , joyce ?
wait .
please .
wait .
that tape , the lulu  you know what , it' s not about the tape .
it' s just ... ... talking to you and seeing lulu .
all that stuff brought up bad memories .
and who am i trying to kid , you know ?
a clean break is easier .
you can reset it ... ... and it heals , and you move on .
but if you leave things messy or things don' t get put right ... ... then it just hurts .
forever .
it' s really time for me to move away from him .
from all this .
i don' t even know who he is anymore .
i should have felt happier at that moment .
i had won .
but the cost was high and the victory hollow .
i had taken a good friend from someone i loved .
and nothing about that felt right .
i needed a reality check .
i needed mom .
but she was out .
so i settled for carly .
the line between right and wrong had blurred .
in my search for truth , i had become the lie .
perhaps some secrets should remain secret .
okay , you guys are not that bright .
can i have an amen ?
is everything okay ?
it' s great .
yeah .
that makes one of us .
what' s the matter ?
i' m not feeling so , you know , good .
you can' t go home .
i mean , i need you .
today' s my show .
i' m a nervous wreck .
we' re live .
oh , my god .
i totally forgot .
of course i' il be here .
wouldn' t miss it for the world .
you are so beautiful , like a real producer .
hello .
headset .
and there was something i needed to tell you .
what was it ?
oh , right .
we' re live .
there she is .
yikes .
showtime .
great to see you .
welcome to kippie kann live .
watch this ladder .
i need a running order .
who' s on first ?
you .
what ?
it' s for you .
what is ?
everything .
let' s see who' s at kippie' s door .
just go with it .
stacy , oh , come on out .
that' s right , stacy .
make yourself comfortable .
you look a little confused .
know the name of today' s show ?
" plastic surgery nightmares " ?
no .
actually it' s called " little black book .
let' s fill our audience in on some recent history .
stacy' s a new member of our staff who' s been using resources here ... ... to do her own personal research ... ... on her boyfriend , derek .
and three of his ex girlfriends .
oh , no .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
she went through his little black electronic book ...
... found his ex girlfriends ...
i don' t believe this . ... and interviewed them under the guise of being a guest on our show .
that' s my idea .
wow , man , too bad .
barb' s upstairs , if you wanna kill her .
and they will be .
but not for the reasons they thought .
take , for example , supermodel lulu fritz .
welcome to kippie kann live .
you used us .
you took my idea , and you set her up .
how can you just stand there ?
camera two .
you stole my idea .
it' s poetry .
you stole it .
i' il share credit .
ira ... ... there' s a bigger thing happening .
just watch .
god , are you watching ?
it was all superficial .
completely about sex .
i' d have to say no .
that' s not from my documentary .
that' s right , lulu .
it' s all a ruse .
a flower ?
a ruse , a joke .
this woman ...
how can you do this ? ... stacy holt , a member of our staff , got you here under false pretenses .
her name' s barbara .
no , the woman producing is barbara .
the woman beside you is the current girlfriend of the man you once dated .
stephen ?
derek .
camera five .
doorbell .
camera five .
doorbell .
another woman scorned , and she doesn' t even know it yet .
come in , dr. keyes .
welcome to kippie kann live .
drama , pathos , life unfolding .
it' s good .
it' s greek .
go to three , phil .
camera three , go .
dr. keyes , you' re a gynecologist .
this woman posed as a patient ... ... to obtain personal information on her boyfriend , whom you once dated .
but i examined her .
well , that was all a setup .
even the warts ?
no , it was a joke .
there were none , ever .
ah , the apex .
joyce .
she thinks she' s doing a pre interview for a cook off .
that' s what you told her , right , stace ?
come in , joyce .
welcome to kippie kann live .
here comes the tough part .
you can do it .
welcome .
what' s with the audience and all these ?
lulu .
oh , that' s right .
you two go way back .
but what about you two ?
barb ?
no , actually , that' s stacy .
derek' s current girlfriend .
what ?
no cook off today .
you lied to me ?
after everything i told you , you lied .
just like she did .
are you referring to me ?
shut up .
what did you say ?
ladies , please .
let' s fill the audience in , shall we ?
we sent our own kippie kann crew to the kaleidoscope kitchen ... ... posing as a crew for 48 hours .
then that was all a rose , too ?
ruse , yeah .
roll it .
why is she calling you stacy , barb ?
because that' s her name .
no , actually , my name is barb .
the other woman you met' s name was stacy .
no , she was barb .
no .
what ?
stimulating as ever .
i' d say it' s nice to see you , but then i' d be lying .
enjoy your meal .
i got sick that night , and not on purpose .
stay put for more surprises when " little black book " continues .
ladies , stay in your seat , okay .
we' re still live .
i' m sorry  don' t don' t say another word .
you wanted me to hate him ?
mission accomplished .
i do .
but , as bad as he is , he is still too good for you .
lf you could have a seat  this is completely unacceptable .
i' il sue this entire show for defamation of character .
this is america , and you are welcome to sue anyone .
but that release you signed is ironclad .
i was told we' d be discussing sexually transmitted diseases .
sexually transmitted diseases .
that' s an idea .
ninety seconds to air .
ninety seconds .
i love it live .
you stoop to conquer .
yeah .
i stoop .
we all do .
i mean , look at where we work .
we march thousands of stacys through here every year .
we uncover their secrets .
we spare no feelings .
but suddenly you get a conscience because you know one personally .
you' re unethical .
you' re a hypocrite .
i' m a hypocrite ?
this show is based on hypocrisy .
you wanna call me unethical ?
okay .
but don' t judge me and then worship kippie for doing the same thing .
we' re all swimming in the same cesspool .
we work in reality tv , lra .
this is reality .
forty five seconds to air , phil .
lra .
underneath your seats ... ... there' s a kippie kann live hat for each one of you .
kippie' s a giver . ... there' s a kippie kann live hat for each one of you .
kippie' s a giver .
i gotta get to the control room .
carl , you wanna handle this ?
got it covered here .
thanks .
you' re all in on this ?
everyone knew ?
there is no conspiracy here .
just a good idea for sweeps .
you can fight it .
seems pointless .
lame .
really stupid .
or you could become a part of something bigger .
something completely different .
now , of course i cannot
but trust me , gonna be big .
huge , it' s giant .
i' m talking about a real show here .
changing formats .
breaking the fourth wall , and the fifth .
kamikaze television without restriction ... ... without hesitation , without kippie .
it' s a pretty exciting time to be on the ground floor .
thanks , carl .
but being that low doesn' t interest me .
don' t fool yourself .
what you did was lower than anything i' ve ever done .
by the way , if you leave now , i will sue you for fraud .
oh , come on .
it' s your 1 5 minutes .
it' s not so bad .
it' s my life .
it' il be over soon .
i meant the show .
five , four , three , two ....
welcome back to kippie kann live .
and " little black book .
i think it' s time to bring out the man of the hour .
what do you say ?
are you ready for derek ?
derek !
derek !
roll scream , roll doorbell .
derek , come on out .
what the ?
derek thought he was coming to a surprise promotion party for stacy .
you' re in for it now !
lulu ?
rach joyce .
what the hell' s going on ?
what are you doing here ?
you can do it .
you wanna tell him , stace , or shall l ?
yes .
i wanna tell him .
i' il do it .
god .
what' s going on ?
tell him !
they' re all here because of me .
they' re all here because of me .
see , after i heard about you and lulu ... ... i interviewed her .
you did what ?
you know , look under the hood first , she' s lulu fritz .
thank you .
we got around to the sex question  wait a minute .
you' re not serious .
she said that you guys did it , like , two , three times a day .
it' s funny .
i mean , why would she lie like that ?
what are you doing ?
purging .
you can go next .
then i went to rachel .
i wanted to go straight to joyce , but i couldn' t .
not right away , so i made up this story about warts ... ... and went to rachel , who i thought was a podiatrist ... ... but it turns out , joke' s on me .
you can shut the cameras off , because it' s never gonna air .
we' re live in 70 markets .
hi , mom .
hi , mom .
then barb and i browsed through your palm .
barb who ?
barbara campbell hyphen dunn .
who sold me out for this show .
just like carl' s selling kippie out .
at least , isn' t that what you told me ?
yes , yes , that' s it .
turn the tables on us all .
that' s real .
it' s honest .
phillip , get carl .
jay , give me a shot to carl .
what are you doing ?
regurgitating .
something sexy just for you , carl .
who' s carl ?
stage left , crooked toupee .
philip , on four .
camera four , go .
get that camera off of me .
phil ?
can' t do this to him .
you hold that shot .
split the screen .
did you know that carl comes in really close ... ... so that america can see that tape you wear on your face right there ?
then he edits it out of the copy he gives you .
back to carl now .
and those tabloid leaks .
nice , really nice .
you' re burying carl .
i' m burying him , her , you , me .
we' re all going down .
go to commercial .
no commercial .
i' m still running things .
stay with me , phil .
not you .
you' il get promoted .
i' m out of here .
i can' t top this .
anyway , barb and i were playing with your palm , and we stumbled ... ... across a lovely montage of joyce ... ... and your folks on holiday .
which is really odd , because you never bring girls home .
i don' t .
you brought her .
she' s different .
why ?
yeah , why ?
tell us !
you know what ?
i' m not doing this .
why ?
you wanna get out of my way ?
is she better for you ?
i guess so .
maybe i always knew it .
maybe that' s why i had to meet her ... ... and when i did , i understood , because i liked her too .
i liked you so much .
i want you to know that .
not in a weird kind of way , but in a way that i thought ... ... maybe in some alternate universe we could be friends .
yesterday , you told me you were schmoozing up some new recruit ... ... and you' re schmoozing joyce ?
no , joyce' s brother .
robbie moore , the recruit , is joyce' s brother .
joyce hooked us up because she' s trying to help me out .
then why wouldn' t you have told me that straight up ?
i mean , why lie ?
i never lied to you !
" omission is betrayal .
yes .
oh , okay .
now you' re gonna tell me about betrayal ?
what the hell do you call this ?
i would never do this to you , ever .
no ?
then answer me this .
if we shared our lives together ... ... why didn' t we share our lives ?
you shouldn' t have to tell me everything , derek .
but why wouldn' t you want to ?
unless there' s somebody else you' re waiting for .
someone who isn' t afraid to say , " the past isn' t past , derek .
or , " i really wanna meet your folks .
or , " i really , really hate hockey .
you do ?
oh , to the bottom of the ninth .
that' s baseball .
you see that ?
i was just too afraid to be honest with you , with myself , because ....
if i was really honest ... ... gut wrenching honest ... ... then i' d have to admit ... ... that we weren' t right the way you guys are .
were we ?
there' s your show , kippie .
my boyfriend belongs with his ex ... ... and i just figured it out .
sue me , carl .
listen .
i' m fully aware that you may never speak to me again .
and i understand .
i do .
but before you leave , i want you to know that this whole idea ... ... wasn' t planned out .
it wasn' t premeditated .
it presented itself , and then i guided it into this ... ... event .
now , granted , it was dramatic .
it was extreme ... ... but you dove head on into the muck and came out ... ... with this masterpiece .
your life back .
i should tear your eyes out right now .
but how will you ever be able to look at yourself in the morning ?
looks like we have an audience .
stay put .
kippie kann live and " little black book " ... ... will be back after these words .
move it , will you ?
how does a girl who jumps into a rabbit hole ... ... plummeting into chaos , come out unchanged ?
she doesn' t .
no , it can' t be closed now .
stacy ?
stacy holt .
it' s bean .
king .
bean king from college .
bean .
bean , what are you doing here ?
inventory .
we just finished .
bean there' s yours ?
the coffee place ?
i come here all the time .
of course it' s yours .
wow , this all makes sense in some cosmic way .
i get it .
i get it .
this must sound crazy to you .
it' s just
i have spent a lifetime preparing for a lifetime .
and i was beginning to think it all went wrong somehow .
but maybe you' re the reason , bean .
for ?
everything .
maybe you' re the plan i was supposed to hang on to .
bean ?
the 8 : 00 was sold out .
should i try the 1 0 : 20 ?
yeah , sure , honey .
i' il be right there .
that' s my wife , colleen .
you should come meet her .
love to , but i just gotta go jump in the river now .
hey , come on , now .
every plan i had for my life went so unbelievably wrong .
john lennon said , " life happens when you' re busy making other plans .
then he got shot .
right .
you just gotta live .
stop planning your moves .
let them happen .
i mean , you might be surprised .
do you believe in happy endings , bean ?
yeah , i think so .
how about you ?
i do .
isn' t that funny ?
i still do with all my heart .
even when the girl doesn' t get the guy in the end .
or , in my case , both guys .
that' s amazing .
congratulations .
thanks .
you go find your happy ending , stacy holt .
and thanks for the continuing patronage .
by fall , i was ready to try again .
a little bruised .
a little humbled .
and , hopefully , a little smarter .
i believe we write our own stories .
and each time we think we know the end ... ... we don' t .
perhaps luck exists somewhere between ... ... the world of planning , the world of chance ... ... and in the peace that comes from knowing ... ... that you just can' t know it all .
you know , life' s funny that way .
once you let go of the wheel , you might end up ... ... right where you belong .
wow , that is such an amazing story .
i mean , you went through all of that , and here you are .
i can do this job , jane .
i' ve been preparing my whole life .
it' s too bad diane' s gone .
she is ?
on assignment .
she' il be back next week .
but before she left ... ... she told me , " lf you find someone great for this job ... ... i mean , perfect ... ... don' t let them go .
welcome aboard , stacy .
you mean ...
... i got the job ?
you got the job .
congratulations .
stay here .
i' il go check diane' s calendar .
thank you .
hello , mama ?
