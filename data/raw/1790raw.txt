she' s my girl .
that' s why she' s not going to l. a.
she' s 16 , for god' s sakes .
what' s wrong with you people ?
hundreds of people apply for this .
if she gets in , it' s proof she belongs there , but you get that , right ?
look , when i was your age , i thought i knew everything too .
but i' ve seen a lot more of the world than you have , paul .
what parts of the world have you seen , dad ?
the back and front of your dad' s restaurant ?
okay , okay .
paul , that' s enough .

dad and i ... need ...
it' s just time .
the only thing i feel bad about is leaving you here .
no .
you don' t have to worry about me .
we get along okay .
yeah , that' s what worries me .
it' s more than getting along , t erri .
you please them .
you' re like a stepford daughter out of a mail order magazine .
is that a form of flattery ?
after dad slammed you on bristol hillman , you' re going to tell me that didn' t hurt ?
no , it totally hurt .
then make a scene !
break something !
scream !
i ... something .
huh huh .
tantrums were never my thing .
terri , you' ve got the best voice i' ve ever heard , but if you hang with the " world according to simon fletcher " any longer , you' re going to be doing " cats " at the y at 40 .
and that would suck .
that would suck .
! " home !! " ! " this house is not a home ... !
what' s up , flagstaff ?
how you guys doing all right ?
! " are you ready for this ? !
paul , don' t oh my god . ! " sit down ! ! " are you ready for this ? ! " ! " shut up !! " ! " are you ready for this ? ! " ! " stand up !! " ! " are you ready ? ! " ! " this game ! " ! " are you ready ? !
! " are you ready ? !
! " are you ready for this ? ! " ! " sit down ! " ! " are you ready for this ? ! " ! " shut up ! " ! " are you ready for this ? ! " ! " stand straight !! " ! " are you ready ? !
paul , look out !
! " are you ready for this ? !
oh !

paul ?
no .
healing nicely .

can you tell me your birthday ?
april 20th .
let' s let t erri get the next one .
tell me what month it is .
june .
what' s wrong with her ?
why can' t she speak ?
terri , tell me what month it is out loud .
it' s june .
that' s good .
now follow this light with your eyes .
doc , stop !
whatever you' re doing , just stop .
i wish i was older .
i' m so afraid i' il say something stupid and make it worse .
hey , aunt nina .
hi , t erri boo berry .
honey .
why was this in the trash ?
you got in .
congratulations .
paul would be so proud of you .
mom , what are you doing ?
if paul were here , he would just get in another screaming fight with dad about it .
okay .
everything is different now .
do you still want to go ?
i don' t want to sing anymore .
i don' t believe that , terri .
why don' t you let me handle your dad about this .
i think terri should come visit me .
hmm .
simon , i really think she needs to get away and i' d like her to come to palm desert for the month of august .
a month with you , alone in the desert ?
are you nuts ?
it is alone , isn' t it ?
i' m between guys right now .
so yes , i' m alone .
yeah , for the moment .
well who' s going to help me in the restaurant ?
oh , is that really what you want to say , simon ?
who' s gonna help me with the restaurant ?
aunt nina , who said that you could do that ?
i' ve never lied to my father before .
terri , i just think this is your life .
you deserve the chance to live it .
then why does it feel so wrong ?
there' s something about your dad that i don' t think you know .
he and his friend david both got football scholarships to ucla .
really ?
and when graduation rolled around , our family restaurant was doing good , but our parents weren' t .
neither of us wanted the restaurant , but your dad felt he had no choice but to take it .
and , uh , his friend david went on to ucla .
and he got caught upin the l. a. scene and he' s been messed up ever since .
but i know that if your dad had taken that scholarship , he would have made it
so , what does that have to do with me ?
i don' t know .
everything ?
but it' s your decision , terri .
he would have wanted you to have this , honey .
paul would have wanted you to have this .
i shouldn' t have snuck him out .
oh , honey , it' s not your fault ,
i feel so bad all the time .
no .
i can' t do this .
i can' t go .
i can' t lie to dad .
it' s just too soon .
honey ...
i will tell dad that you' re really not at nina' s when the time is right .
and he' s gonna be mad at first .
but he' s gonna realize it was the right thing to do .
you sure it' s the right thing to do ?
no .
i' m not sure of anything .
i just want you to be happy .
okay .
i' il do it .
okay .
are you guys gonna be okay ?
yeah .
yeah .
we' il be fine .
uh , i' m taking her to the train station .
and , uh , nina will pick her up on the other end .
we' il be fine .
here you go .
this is for you .
dad .
i don' t want nina to pay for everything , and uh ...
you wanna come home early , you call us , okay ?
okay .
i love you .
me too .
call me , okay ?

hi .
i' m terri , your roommate .
yeah .
denise .
okay , everyone .
take a seat .
let' s be seated .
in case you bought that old saw that those who can' t do , teach .
these talented musicians beside me are your teachers .
but i' d prefer you to think of them as your guides .
hello , and welcome to bristol hillman' s summer music program .
i' d like to start by reminding you of the large number of talented students who applied but did not get in .
now , this summer is not just about learning your craft .
it' s about testing your limits experimenting .
new experiences .
it' s about building up and rocking the foundation of that which will give you your own individual voice .
now , some basics .
we have a strict 10 : 00 curfew , 1 1 : 00 on the weekends .
possession of banned substances will mean immediate dismissal .
hmm .
this is l. a. , people .
use some common sense .
travel in pairs .
lastly , the scholarship .
three weeks from now , on the last day of the program , we will have final performances where you show us what you' ve got .
now a lucky student will win a $10, 000 academic scholarship for music study .
that' s pretty good , huh ?
so , work hard .
have fun .
get lost .
later .
okay .
i gave her three chances .
the chances have come and gone .
send her back where she came from .
i don' t care !
people , grab a seat .
my name is mr. torvald .
you are my class and we have three weeks to learn an incredibly complex choral piece .
it ain' t ever gonna happen , but let' s give it the ol ' college try , shall we ?
there are five solos in the ensemble .
only five people will perform solos in front of this class .
and i will hand them outin two weeks based on participation , exercises and je nai sais quoi .
if you' re not french , that means ,
ooh !
i will also split you up into groups of four .
yes , i still count on my fingers .
one for each part in the obnoxiously difficult contrapuntal harmony at the end of the book .
this piece is gonna drive you nuts .
but when you nail it , it feels good .
you .
you .
you .
you .
group one !
hey , jay !
nice hook
jump in and pick it up .
hey .
is anybody sitting here ?
how many of you can identify this note ?
you there .
what is the note ?
a " b ?
b flat !
the ability to know any note when you hear it is great asset .
those of you who don' t have it must work that much harder .
is the same with your ability to read music .
your opportunities are expanded .
if you look at a piece of music , see how the notes are arranged on the page and hear exactly what it is , each note in your head .
this is something you will learn to do this summer in your individual studies with me .
i' m so sorry .
that was me .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m i' m fine .
i' m sorry .
that was my fault .
i was in the way .
no , it' s good .
it was my fault .
i should really learn to stand .
okay .
awesome .
she doesn' t even know .
hey .
how' s it going ?
couldn' t be better .
should i ask for a single ?
am i bothering you that much ?
hey .
hold up .
i mean , i just get the feeling that i' m some kinda pain in your butt .
look , it' s not even like that , all right ?
i' m here for that scholarship .
i' m just about hardcore focus .
well it seems really personal .
oh , please .
i' m not even trying to hear that .
look , we' re all up against each other for that money .
so i just gotta be able to do my thing and not get caught up in any personalities .
i don' t really mean nothing by it .
so , we cool ?
yeah .
we' re cool .
cool .
hey , mr. torvald .
hey , robin .
i wanted to let you know that i tried those exercises you gave me last summer and they really helped .
i just wanted to say thank you so much .
my pleasure .
oh , and i' il have you know that i' m gunning for those solos .
well , i' il keep an eye out for you .
thank you , mr. torvald . ! " for the lord god omnipotent reigneth ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " for the lord god omnipotent reigneth ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah . !
ouch and cut .
sorry , that was me .
yeah , we know .

! " she she doesn' t even know , know , know , know !
thanks anyways .
you' re a serious weirdo .
it isn' t lucky unless it' s face up .
but now it' s just a penny that thinks it' s lucky , but it isn' t .
well now it can be lucky for someone else .
besides , haven' t you ever heard of making your own luck ?
well , what do you know ?
a lucky penny .
so , an englishman in l. a.
yeah , my parents put an ocean between them after the nastiest divorce ever .
no joke , people study it .
so , how can you have a sense of humor about that ?
my music became like a religion .
it kept me sane .
so , music is your higher power .
pretty much .
i mean , look at this .
this city .
all these people .
all this life and music .
i' m gonna make music for them .
i can' t think of a better way to spend my life .
are you missing home ?
a little bit .
i don' t know .
it' s just been really tough lately .
come on .
i just gave you my " e !
true hollywood story .
you gotta give me something .
um .
me and my brother were in a car accident on the day of his graduation .
and , um , some drunk driver ran through a red light and
hey , terri !
come here .
uh , look , terri , i' ve gotta go . somebody .
look , say hi to denise for me .
hey .
hey , was that jay running off ?
yeah .
figures .
what , was he macking on you ?
not that i could tell .
well , count your blessings , ' cause i know his game .
he likes to hit on nice girls .
and baby , you you got a lock on that one .
what ?
i mean , look at you .
look at your hair , your clothes , the way you talk .
you' re like some kinda retro brady buncher .
shoot , i' m not even trying to hear that .
okay , that was cute .
my bad .
i didn' t know you could do t
yeah .
my teachers are always harping about how it' s bad for me .
you know , how i' m gonna lose my ear .
but i just like how it sounds in here .
hello .
oh hi , honey .
um , dad wants to talk to you .
um , simon , pick up .
hey , sweetheart .
how' s it going ?
hanging in there ?
yeah , everything' s good .
sure do miss you .
i miss you too , dad .
what was that ?
sounded like a siren .
uh , no , no .
it' s nothing .
well , it didn' t sound like nothing .
it sounded pretty close .
the neighbors are out of town and their alarm keeps going off so , i' m gonna go talk to the police , okay ?
i' il call you back .
all right , bye .
okay , bye , honey .
uh , what , terri , wait .
terri ?
i' m gonna lose it . ! " king of kings ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " and lord of lords ... ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah !
yes . ! " king of kings ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " and lord of lords ... !
i can never get that note .
i can' t believe this .
i can .
problem , ladies ?
yeah , i think that some of us maybe need to practice this a little bit more outside of class .
meow !
why don' t you let me worry about that , hmm ?
okay , that' s it .
done for the day .
go on .
get outta here .
ms. fletcher .
okay , i give up .
what did you do with the girl on the dvd ?
excuse me ?
the lively , funny , talented girl , what did you do with her ?
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
i sent my songs on a cd .
no , there was also a dvd .
it came in late .
we almost didn' t see it .
but it' s a big part of the reason why you are here .
sit down .
be comfortable .
okay , mr. t orvald .
i did not send it .
i really have no idea what you' re talking about .
no ?
well .
let me introduce you to one interesting , fascinating lady .
maybe you' il be inspired .
i know we were .
terri' s my sister .
and , uh , she' s my favorite person in the whole world .
she like a challenge .
she thrives when she' s pushed .
and the people who can do that , they don' t live in flagstaff .
terri deserves a chance to learn from the best .
she' s already good .
but she could be great .
if you let her in , you won' t be disappointed .
hey , terri ?
terri !
terri .
are you okay ?
please .
it' s probably just some weirdo misfit thing .
no .
the show' s over .
okay , you can go now .
look , whatever it is , you can' t leave .
it' s copping out .
what are you doing here ?
same as everybody else .
the music thing .
ducking a summer job .
i mean here in my doorway .
look , come on .
let' s just get outta here .
come on .
let' s just go .
the bag isn' t walking away .
how do i know you won' t ?
i was sitting right next to him .
and he died and i didn' t .
you know ?
and i don' t know why .
but i miss him .
the second i start to feel like i' m enjoying myself , this voice comes inside my head and .. it' s like , " how can you be having a good time when paul is dead ?
you can' t blame yourself like that .
you don' t understand
it was my fault
i got him to sneak out .
i shouldn' t have risked it .
look , t erri .
some idiot ran a red light .
it was bad luck .
messed up timing .
that' s all .
you weren' t there .
look , i can' t imagine what you' re going through .
but i do know from experience backing down can become a way of life
don' t leave .
screw the pressure .
screw the scholarship .
i mean , do your own thing on your own terms .
and get what you came here for .
that' s what counts .
but jay , i' m lying to people .

paul' s cross .

nice .
improving .
we' ve got 10 minutes left .
i want to run the third section .
has anybody seen terri ?
i can sing the part , mr. t orvald , i know it backwards and forwards .
it' s t erri' s solo , so lets wait for her .
but she' s not even here .
and it' s not like she can sing it anyway .
terri' s worked hard for it .
she deserves it .
no , i deserve this part !
stop it .
jeez .
well i guess you have a new favorite now !
whoa , whoa .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t understand .
i don' t i don' t see how things can just go from being so great one summer to turn to such crap the next .
i' m sorry , robin .
can we talk ?
i mean , privately ?
hey , mr. t orvald .
i' m sorry i missed class .
well , that' s okay .
are you feeling better ?
what ?
if you missed my class , you must be deathly ill .
it' s too bad because we were gonna work on your solo today .
i' m not ready for a solo .
yes , you are .
don' t you even know how much you' ve improved since you' ve been here ?
okay , but there are much better singers here , mr. t orvald
i' il be the judge of that .
we' il try it again tomorrow .
look , terri , there' s people in the class who are desperate to do this solo , so if you don' t care about the work , what have you been doing here ?
this is so humiliating .
you' re suppose to be with me .
look , just take it easy .
worse things have happened , right ?
yeah , all the time .
just not to me .
i always get my way .
is that a bad thing to say ?
well , maybe a little , yeah .
but i thought you liked bad .
maybe a little bad ?
come on , we got along really well last summer , didn' t we ?
people change , robin .
i' m not the same person i was last summer .
neither are you .
i don' t know .
i think we can be those two people again .
don' t you ?
hey , have you seen jay ?
uh , heading to the practice room , i think .
i think i know the problem .
i' m bad .
but i can be better .
terri , wait !
terri !
t erri !
terri , wait !
wait .
jerk !
terri !
jay ?
stay away from me !
terri !
stupid .
! " i don' t know your face ! " ! " no more !
! " or feel the touch ! " ! " that i adore !
! " i don' t know your face ! " ! " no more ! " ! " it' s just a place ! " ! " i' m looking for ... !
t erri , come on , please .
she doesn' t want to talk to you .
just back off .
! " we might as well be living ! " ! " in another town ! " " we might as well ! " ! " we might as well ! " ! " we might as well ! " ! " be strangers ... !
! " be strangers !
! " for all i know ! " ! " of you now !
! " for all i know . !
aw , hey .
you okay ?
it' s nothing .
i' m sorry if i was hard on you the other day .
i just want you to know that i' m here for you if you need anything .
if you want to talk anything .
okay ?
have you ever lost anyone ?
yeah
i just can' t let this go .
well , you' re an artist and artists feel things differently than regular people .
look at patsy cline or billie holiday .
you could hear it in their voice .
or , vincent van gogh cut off his ear , but hey , he could paint .
vincent van gogh killed himself .
that' s right .
that' s a bad example .
hey , i' m a music teacher , not a shrink .
what do you want ?
i guess ... what i' m trying to say is artists convey emotion .
they make an audience feel what they' re feeling .
you know , that' s what it' s all about , right ?
you just have to find a way to take what' s in here and put it in here .
what the hell .
who is it ?
it' s jay .
let me in !
go away , you jackass !
no , no , no !
i just please , i just want to talk to terri , okay ?
just let me in .
he sounds drunk .
uh , you think ?
hey , girl , do not open that door .
okay , i' m gonna make him leave , all right ?
jay , you have to leave now .
no !
ow !

what' s going on ? !
i saw you kissing her , okay ?
no , no .
you shut up !
come on , terri .
i' m trying to sleep .
sh i wasn' t kissing her .
she was she was kissing me .
oh no .
he didn' t even try to go there , please .
i' m sure that makes a lot of sense , jay , when you' re drunk .
t erri , i don' t care about her .
i care about you .
boy , who you trying to play ?
terri ?
denise , just chill out , all right ?
look , terri , i care about you .
you know i do .
why would you do that ?
why would you drink ?
because , because i' m i' m worthless .
you know what ?
don' t even try and give me that self pity thing , okay ?
terri , look .

we' il discuss it at home .
i' m not leaving . and i did this for me and i' m gonna finish it for me .

each year we present a $1 0, 000 academic scholarship in music studies to an outstanding student in the summer music program
this year' s program was better than most , full of talented , hardworking students .
it' s a shame we only have one scholarship to give .
so without further ado , the board of directors of the bristol hillman music conservatory is pleased to present this scholarship to ...
denise gilmore .
oh honey !
you were so wonderful !
oh , thank you !
truly amazing but then again , it' s in the genes .
aunt nina , thank you for everything .
