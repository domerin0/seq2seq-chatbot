this time it' s a martial art film .
the heroine is a bounty hunter .
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days .
the worst of his kind .
what happened ?
his name' s gyeon woo ?
gyeon woo ?
the story' s setting is a mess .
japan invades during king sejong' s reign , and the king' s father is the tyrant yeonsan .
in the end , the heroine fights the villain in a field .
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day .
the heroine becomes a king .
king jung jo .
she' s from the future , of course .
it' s fun , huh ?
why is the heroine always from the future ?
science is advanced then , so they invent a time machine .
and people go to the past to travel .
people from the future could be here now .
i think ufos are time machines .
someday , i' il meet someone from the future .
i have to .
if you do , ask him to take you .
what ?
if it' s possible ...
give this to shin cine .
tell them to cast han suk gyu and shim eun ha .
jeon do yun is okay , too .
excuse me , we talked on the phone , right ?
well ... this is ' the warrior' s sad love story ' ...
it' s going to be a hit .
shin cine didn' t call back .
hey !
hey , kid .
is the subway your sketch book ?
don' t scribble on it .
wanna die ?
my lipstick !
i always take her home , even to bupyung station .
it' s something a man must do .
on the way , we play fun games , too .
ieft foot over the line , i win .
with the right foot , you win .
what' s the prize ?
iet' s see ...
how about a kiss ?
a kiss ?
wanna die ?
you choose .
hitting each other .
again ?
you can hit me , too .
okay .
someone' s coming .
i think this is unfair .
i m a girl , so i' il slap the cheek .
no .
then i' il change it , too .
but i' m a girl .
men and women are equal .
okay , then .
you slap , and i slap , too .
go easy on me , and i' il kill you .
better slap me on the cheek .
if you don' t , i' il kill you !
all right .
you slap , and i' il use my finger .
right , that' s fair .
saw that ?
see that guy step over with his left foot ?
i had my eyes closed .
plus he came the opposite way .
i thought it was this way .
shut up .
here they come .
a staff sergeant : ieft foot .
left foot .
it' il be the right foot .
a staff sergeant : ieft !
left !
switch to the right .
you have to hit me ?
you know why the sky is blue ?
' cause the reflection of the sunshine .
nope .
it' s for me !
i want it to be blue .
so , it' s blue .
you know why the fire is hot ?
it' s all for me .
i want it to be hot .
so it is .
you know why we have four seasons here in korea .
because of you .
that' s correct !
and why you were born here ?
it' s for me as well .
what ?
that' s nonsense .
i was born before you .
you know the word of ' worship ' ?
' peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus . ' huh ?
well ...
yeah , i know .
so , get ready !
come here .
stay still .
ugh !
uh uh uh !
when i' m with her ,
i never know how the day will turn out .
what ?
what are you looking at ?
i quit !
is your face a racket ?
why does the ball always hit my face ?
it' s strange .
i never want to lose a game .
so i play until i win .
wait long ?
just a teeny bit .
my mom bought me these heels , but they' re killing my feet .
want a massage ?
no , it' s okay .
instead , let' s exchange shoes .
don' t wanna ?
how can a guy wear heels ?
it' il fit .
but , i can' t ...
yeah ?
i see .
come on .
i' il buy you some sneakers .
forget it .
then wear mine , and i' il carry yours .
you don' t understand women .
okay !
let' s exchange .

wanna know a secret ?
what is it ?
i don' t wear panties on exam day .
but i had one today .

hey .
if you don' t , i' il kill you .
phew catch me , honey !

it was just a second , but i felt something in her eyes .
that' s my house .
wait .
i' il bring you an umbrella .
i m okay .
i' m already wet so i' il just leave .
eh ?
gee

yes , sir .
how much do you know about my daughter ?
not much ...
next time , don' t hang out till late .
you don' t understand me .
why' d you stand him up ?
what' s wrong with him ?
why do you stand guys up ?
and what happened to your heels ?
what' s wrong with you ?
i told you not to meet gyeon woo .
he' s dumb and has no future .
it' s none of your business .
why is he stupid ?
you' re stupid so you don' t know .
what has gotten in to you ?
iet me live my own life !
afterwards ,
i didn' t hear from her for a long time .
hello ?
gyeon woo , it' s me .
iong time no see .
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her .
our 100th day celebration is soon .
it' s 100 days already ?
when do you think a girl' s the prettiest ?
when a sexy woman is naked .
where are you now ?
stay right there .
no , i' m just kidding .
the prettiest is when she' s playing the piano .
what' s your favorite song ?
that george winston song .
pachelbel' s ' canon ' ?
yeah , that song .
you' re not gonna ask me ?
when is the guy the prettiest ?
just give me a rose .
still have your high school uniform ?
yeah .
why ?
bring it on our 100th day , and give me a rose during my class .
do it yourself , okay ?
what ?
what did you say ?
how can i during class ?
hey !
just hung up on me !
damn it !
i don' t wanna get beaten by her , or get humiliated at a women' s college .
oh my god !
a burglar !
help , a burglar !
eh ?
are you crazy ?
you' re gonna break into where ?
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight ?
and you ...
why you didn' t drop by an aunt' s coming and going bupyung for the girl .
you never know how much hard time i went through for you .
she even intends to introduce a girl to you .
gyeon woo !
where are you going ?
i m cleverer than i look .
these girls sure love chinese food .
hey , you !
where you headed ?
come here !
i m delivering chinese food .
i ordered it .
bring it here .
really ?
bring a lot of radish ?
oh , i forgot something !
give me the food first !
that' s the wrong way !
there' s another customer .
hey !
but that wasn' t enough for her .
we relived our old high school days .
drink !
drink till die !
i' ve never had anything like this .
gee !
sorry , i' m gonna drink it in my way .
feeling so good !
have a smoke , too !
wow , i' ve never had a smoke , either !
gonna be a big deal .
i don' t smoke well ...
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher .
it' s a suspension !
you' ve already had your ups and downs in life .
go ahead and smoke !
hey , you are such a tough cookie !
you go to very good school !
not to worry .
this clothes is so tight !
after we visited that club , a school uniform party was held every month .
but she got wasted again .
oh , wild teens !
here' s a condom .
iet' s prevent alds .
taxi !
she' s having a happy dream .
compared to when i looked at her in the motel the first time , she looks so different .
could her pain be cured now ?
maybe it means that she doesn' t need me anymore .
excuse me .
can you drive slowly ?
here .
have any plans after graduation ?
actually , i' ve never thought about it yet .
can i see what' s in your pocket ?
sir ?
right .
' it' s a condom . '
what is this for ?
oh , right .
i learned that it prevents alds .
but i haven' t used it yet .
actually , on the way here .
forget it .
' chicks hen ' ?
what does this mean ?
oh , right .
it' s a chicken soup restaurant .
' we' il satisfy all your wishes ? '
i think it' s to satisfy our tastes .
' hurry and tell him . '
how do feel about our daughter ?
oh , right .
we' re just friends now .
please don' t worry .
if we get closer , i' il let you know , sir .
don' t see her any more .
after that day , she never calls me .
it was sudden , but that' s how we broke up .
we' re broken up .
now , i' m free .
it' s me .
come to the cafe by seven o' clock .
why ?
what ?
i have a blind date today .
come in 45 minutes .
i have a blind date , too .
are you on your way ?
i m on a date with a girl .
hurry up .
i have to go to the bathroom .
' gotta go to the bathroom . '
eh ?
nice to meet you .
i m cha seok won .
nice to meet you .
same here .
have a seat .
were you really with a girl ?
no , i was with a guy .
can i take your order ?
coffee , please .
you can drink coke .
i' il drink coffee .
gyeon woo .
you' re very lucky .
i heard a lot about you .
that you' re close friend .
friend ...
i need to go to the bathroom .
how is he ?
no idea ... but he looks nice .
he is not the man you broke up with , is he ?
how do you know ?
when you see a new man ... forget about the past , all right ?
how the hell do you know ?
this necklace is given from your ex boyfriend , isn' t it ?
you wouldn' t wear it if you just broke up for nothing .
considering your temper ... and you ... used to tell that you couldn' t get over him .
does that mean he isn' t here anymore in this world ?
that man is the one my mom introduced me to meet .
she kept pushing me to meet him ...
doesn' t look bad guy , does he ?
yes .
hey , listen !
i m totally ok , but you should be obedient to man .
man likes something more feminine .
and ... don' t drink a lot .
some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated .
and it' s all right with me , but to the other guys try to surrender for just once .
... not try to win .
good luck to you .
where' s gyeon woo ?
he left already .
he told me ten rules to follow .
i have a good memory .
i' il recite them .
first , don' t ask her to be feminine .
and don' t ...
second , don' t let her drink over three glasses .
she' il beat someone .
at a cafe , drink coffee instead of coke or juice .
if she hits you , act like it hurts .
if it hurts , act like it doesn' t .
on your 100th day together , give her a rose during her class .
she' il like it a lot .
make sure you learn fencing and squash .
also , be prepared to go to prison sometimes .
if she says she' il kill you , don' t take it lightly .
you' il feel better .
if her feet hurts , exchange shoes with her .
finally , she likes to write .
encourage her .
ladies and gentlemen , please pay attention to here ...
gyeon woo .
step backward on the yellow line ...
gyeon woo !
... after passenger' s getting off , take in order ...
gyeon woo !
... please use the next train .
what' s his name ?
gyeon woo .
i' il do it myself .
gyeon woo .
where are you ?
i looked all over for you .
gyeon woo .
come to the escalator .
okay ?
you' re dead if you don' t .
hurry up .
who told you to hug me ?
dummy .
you' re supposed to dodge .
sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don' t .
we' re definitely standing at the crossroad now .
what' s going on between us ?
can this relationship last forever ?
who is it ?
it' s me , dad .
she told me to write a letter and bring it .
to write it on paper .
to express my feelings ,
i tried hard to find the right words .
when i first met her ,
i wanted to cure her grief , but now i can' t give her up .
i wish we can get serious .
i' m writing about these feelings .
she' s probably writing about me now .
this is how we' re preparing to split up .
gyeon woo .
see that mountain top ?
yeah .
could someone hear me from there ?
yes , probably so .
or probably not .
then go over there .
i' il shout here .
if you hear , answer me .
you want me to go over there ?
yeah .
gyeon woo ?
can you hear me ?
gyeon woo !
i' m sorry .
i really can' t help it .
gyeon woo .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry ...
i can' t help it .
i thought i was different , but i' m just a helpless girl .
gyeon woo !
i' m sorry .
did you bring your letter ?
yeah .
what' s that ?
a time capsule .
we put our letters in it and bury it here .
and two years later , let' s meet here again .
we' il read the letters that day , and maybe we can find an answer then .
this was her way of saying good bye , and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn' t long .
iet' s open this exactly two years later , at two , okay ?
we can meet two years later .
when we meet then , we' il be different from what we are now .
we may become closer , or stay forever apart .
we can only choose one .
gyeon woo .
you go first .
iet' s separate here .
should we go together ?
no , i' il take the next train .
i think that' s better .
see you two years later !
okay , in two years !
two years !
bye !
gyeon woo !
that' s how we broke up .
overtime
i couldn' t endure the loneliness after we broke up .
thinking of those memories ,
i started to write about our stories on the internet .
then i made up my mind .
if i meet her again , i' il show her a different myself .
got to make use of my time .
for her and my future' s sake .
why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face ?
i wrote our stories on the internet everyday , and i kept myself busy for two years .
yup !
excuse me .
i wrote ' my sassy girl ' .
shin cine saw my writing , and offered to make a movie out of it .
i made her dream come true instead .
i wanted to tell her right away , but i can only wait till that day .
she didn' t come .
it' s our only day to meet .
no one knows when she will come .
wow !
how did he get in here ?
it' s a mystery .
gyeon woo !
how are you ?
i was so happy while being with you .
i' m not sure if you knew , but the person i loved passed away .
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year ago .
actually , i tried to look for him in you .
i know it was wrong .
i' m sorry .
i also met him on the subway like you .
i was really sick at that time .
he did everything i wanted .
like you did to me .
under this tree , we planned our future together .
but he suddenly passed away .
while i was dating you , i met his mother often .
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me , but i couldn' t .
the day i first met you , i came under this tree , and i prayed to him .
to let me free .
when i met you , this occurred to me .
that maybe ... he introduced you to me .
but the more i met you , he seemed to grow jealous of you in me .
the more i liked you , i felt guilty inside .
while the two of us are apart ,
i want to forget him alone .
after that day , i went often to this place .
if i' m not with you after two years , it means i still lack of courage .
how much will we change after two years ?
i feel like you live in the future , and i stay in the past .
i want to meet you soon , so i can read your letter .
why are you staring at me , sir ?
because you' re so pretty .
i thought an angel came down .
do you come here often ?
sometimes .
this tree has a secret .
i have a secret here , too .
really ?
three years ago , i buried a letter here with my boyfriend .
what' s your secret ?
so what happened ?
we promised to read the letters a year ago .
but i couldn' t come .
i guess you' re a year late .
but two years didn' t seem that long .
i haven' t made any decision yet .
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts .
iike what ?
if we were destined to meet ,
i thought we' d meet by chance somewhere .
know what fate is ?
building a bridge of chance for someone you love .
to be honest , i read you guys letters .
i said this tree had a secret , right ?
yes .
iook closely .
does this tree look the same as before ?
well , it looks like it changed a bit .
but i' m not sure .
people are dead or alive .
there' s a dead tree and a living tree , too .
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year .
it was split into two .
but this young man felt sorry for it .
during this spring , he planted another tree that looked the same .
when he planted the tree , he asked me if it look the same .
he said that someone would be sad if it died , so no one should know .
gyeon woo ...
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service .
please , call again .
hi .
it' s been a while .
you' ve gotten prettier .
you still look young .
how have you been ?
you were in england ?
yes .
for one and a half years .
so i can forget him .
i see .
feel better ?
yes .
a lot better .
is it true now ?
my son might be sad .
he won' t .
he' il like it this way .
good , that' s what i really hoped .
auntie !
i was getting my photo taken .
you naughty boy .
know how long it' s been ?
sorry i didn' t tell you before .
this is gyeon woo .
doesn' t he resemble him ?
when you had a hard time ,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years , but he kept getting out of it .
heard you came to bupyung often , but you never visited me ?
go out with him .
i thought he' d make things easy for you .
oh , yeah .
gyeon woo , you' re going to england , right ?
she' s already been there , so she can give you some tips .
i don' t have to go now .
why ?
you two know each other ?
you may not believe it , but i think i met a man from the future .
from your future .
this is how i met her again .
think it' s too coincidental ?
it' s building a bridge of chance for your love .
