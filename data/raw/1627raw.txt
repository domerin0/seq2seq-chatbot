pete told me you used that rider in a real interestin ' way .

yeah , tom .
i know not to talk you out of somethin ' you set your mind to , but alvin , you' ve always struck me as smart .
well , that' s appreciated .
until now .
what year ?
' 66 .
kohler engine .
we' ve used it for parts but i always replace them .
the guts are good .
it' s got the old transmission .
nothing fancy .
is it a good machine ?
it' s good .
tom , i got $325 .
that' s a fact .
sounds good to me , alvin .
let' s go settle up with alice .
one more thing , sometime you can find out about these old machines , if you know who run ' em .
do you know who owned it ?
you bet ...
me .
all right .
i couldn' t get a ride .
are you hungry ?
whaddaya got ?
weeners .
weeners ?
weeners .
wanna try one ?
here' s a good stick for you .
what a hunk ofjunk .
eat your dinner , missy .
so , ... how long you been out on the road ?
well , i been travellin ' most of my life .
where you from ?
laurens .
got a wife back there ?
kids ?
my wife , francis delivered 14 babies .
seven of ' em made it .
my daughter , rose lives with me .
francis died in ' 81 .
where' s your family ?
are you runnin ' away ?
how far along are ya ?
five months .
well , i' m headin ' to see my brother lyle .
huh ?
i said i' m goin ' to see my brother lyle in mount zion .
where' s that ?
wisconsin .
oh ...
just across the state line .
cheddar heads .
aren' t those the dumbest things you ever seen somebody stick on their head ?
i hear that' s a real party place wisconsin .
guess i' il never get to find out .
there' s a blanket in the trailer .
why don' t you go get it ?
my family hates me .
they' il really hate me when they find out .
you didn' t tell ' em ?
no .
no one knows .
not even my boyfriend .
well , they may be mad , but i don' t think they' re mad enough to wanna lose you or your little problem .
i don' t know about that .
well , of course , neither do i , but a warm bed and a roof sounds a might better than eatin ' a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer that' s travellin ' on a lawn mower .
my daughter rose is ...
some people call her a little bit slow but she' s not .
she' s got a mind like a bear trap for facts .
she keeps everything organised around the house .
she was a real good mom .
she had four kids .
one night , somebody else was watchin ' the kids and there was a fire .
her second boy got burned real bad .
rose had nothin ' to do with it but , ah ... .. on account of the way rose is , the state figured she wasn' t competent to take care of them kids and they took ' em all away from her .
there isn' t a day goes by that she don' t pine for them kids .
when my kids were real little , i used to play a game with ' em .
i' d give each one of ' em a stick and one for each one of ' em then i' d say " you break that .
' course they could , real easy .
then i' d say " tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that " .
' course they couldn' t .
then i' d say " that bundle ... .. that' s family .
why don' t you sleep in the trailer ?
this chair' sjust fine for me tonight .
no , i' il be fine sleepin ' out here .
lookin ' at the stars helps me think .
well ...
thank you .
woo !
what the ... ?
what the hell ?
hey , how' re you doin ' ?
doin ' good .
hey , irene .
you don' t think about gettin ' old when you' re young .
you shouldn' t .
must be something good about gettin ' old .
well , i can' t imagine anything good about being blind and lame at the same time , but ... still at my age , i' ve seen about all that life has to dish out .
i know to separate the wheat from the chaff and let the small stuff fall away .
let' s go , man . >
so , ah ... what' s the worst part about being old , alvin ?
the worst part of being old is rememberin ' when you was young .
> > >
can i help you , lady ?
no , you can' t help me .
no one can help me .
i' ve tried driving with my lights on , sounding my horn !
i scream , i roll the window down and bang on the door and play public enemy real loud !
i' ve prayed to st francis of assisi , st christopher too !
what the heck !
i' ve tried everything and still every week
i hit at least one deer !
i have hit 13 deer in seven weeks driving down this road !
and i have to drive down this road every day , 40 miles to work and back .
i have to drive to work and i have to drive home !
where do they come from ?
oh ... he' s dead .
and i love deer .
well , they sure picked the right place to practise a burn on .
that rumelthanger place was an eyesore .
< what do you suppose ... ?
is that a lawn mower ?
mister , you ok ?
jeez , mister , you' re lucky she didn' t roll on you .
i guess the belt broke .
i wouldn' t be surprised .
you don' t have brakes on that trailer , right ?
i worked for john deere for 30 years , you shouldn' t be hauling a rig behind a mower .
at least not down a hill like that .
i' m danny riordan .
alvin straight .
alvin , let' s get you and this rig off the road and see what the damage is .
let' s get this off the road .
sure you' re ok ?
ok .
you ok ?
everything all right ?
i' m going back to the exercise .
thanks .
appreciate it .
well , ... let' s take a look at this mower .
this is what ' 65 , ' 66 ?
' 66 .
well , ... tell you right now , alvin , you won' t be going anywhere tonight .
aside from your , ah , drive belt being busted , you got transmission problems .
where you headed ?
mount zion .
mount zion , wisconsin ?
past prairie du chien ?
that' s 60 more miles of hills .
that' s across the mississippi .
what' s in mount zion , alvin ?
my brother lives there .
why didn' t you take your car ?
i' m not licensed .

he' s had a bad stroke .
where are you coming from ?

that' s my rollin ' home .
where you been settin ' up camp ?
in the fields .
i pull off .
i don' t travel at night .
haven' t you been scared , being alone ?
there are weird people everywhere .
well , ma' am , i fought in the trenches in world war il .
why should i be scared of an iowa cornfield ?
well , um ... till we get this mower fixed , ... why don' t you ... ah , bivouac in our yard here ?
there' s a bathroom in the garage you can use .
well , that' s awful generous of you and i' m sure my machine here is agreeable to that too .
sure wanna thank you folks for helping me today .
there' s a lot of rain forecast .
sure don' t want to get stuck in that trailer .
i ... i do a little woodwork .
i thought you' d like a few fish .
my daughter does woodwork .
she makes birdhouses .
oh , that' s nice .
you finished there ?
i believe i am .
i' m in need of a phone .
sure .
come in .
i wanna tell my daughter about my recent travels .

if it' s all the same with you , do you have a cordless phone ?
door' s wide open , come ...
i can call from out here .
here you go .
you' re welcome to sit in the kitchen .
we can leave , if you' re lookin ' for privacy .
out here' s fine .
is the area code still 712 here ?
no , alvin .
that hill rolled you into 319 .
you need to dial one and your area code .
712 , thank you .
' hello ? '
rose ?
dad ? ... dad ...
uh , i' m ... so glad to hear you .
it' s gonna cost him a bundle to fix that mower .
i don' t think he' s got that kinda money .
i wouldn' t drive that thing to excelsior .
it' s a lawn mower , for god' s sake .
uh , your social security cheque ?
ah ... it' s here , dad .
rose , can you send me my cheque ?
uh , yeah .
he' s damn lucky he made it down that hill .
he could' ve died easily .
yeah .
he' s none too strong .
see how he has to walk with the canes ?
ok , dad .
i ... i ...
ok , ok , dad , ok .
i ... i have a pencil , dad . < the hillsjust get worse the closer you get to the mississippi .

oh , i' m makin ' my mexican coffee .
ah .
mind if i join you ?
get you a chair ... that iron one there .
you' il be a guest in your own back yard .
amm , i talked to the olsen twins , and , ah ... they estimate it' il cost around 250 dollars to get your mower fixed .
well , that' s twice what it oughta be ,
i guess it' s cos they' re twins , huh ?
i' d be happy to drive you the rest of the way to mount zion .
be a nice sunday drive .
we enjoy crossin ' the river , especially now with the trees in colour .
well , i appreciate that , but ... .. i wanna finish this one my own way .
try this .
thank you .
well , you know , alvin , there' s a lotta hills bigger than clairmont' s between here and zion .
even if you get that mower runnin ' again , it may still break down .
well , you' re a kind man talkin ' to a stubborn man .
i still wanna finish this the way i started .
no , no ...
hi , verlyn .
how the heck you doin ' ?
fine .
wonderful .
he' s there .
well ... they gave you a plate of her brownies .
yeah .
how' s that for timing ?
janet makes the best brownies ... in lafayette county .
she won prizes every year at the county fair .
mmm ... help yourself .
thank you .
mmm ... i' ve been doin ' errands and i' m heading for a beer .
i thought you' d like to join me .
well , i don' t drink any more , but ...
i' m always up for a change of scenery .
well , come on .
well , i' m ridin ' a little higher and a little faster .
except when you came down that hill .
i picked up a mournful taste for liquor in france .
when i came back , i couldn' t drink enough of it .
i wasn' t worth a stick of stove wood ...
i was mean .
a preacher helped me put some distance between me and the bottle .
and he helped me see ... the reason i was drinkin ' , i was seein ' all them things here , that i' d seen over there .
# though things may look very dark , your dream is not ... #
lots of men came back drinkin ' hard .
well ... everyone tryin ' to forget .
i can see it in a man right away .
yup .
# the rainbow , you will suddenly ... #
552 ]
there was one time ... when we just ...
were waiting for the first warm meal in ten days .
we ... thought we' d seen the worst .
we hadn' t had much trouble from the air .
i was on the rise ... with the quartermaster , workin ' on more coffee for me and my buddies .
a stray fokker came over the treetops ... and dropped an incendiary on the mess tent .
all my buddies ...
the kraut banked right in front of me on that hill ... and now i can ... see the ... swastika .
that is one thing that i can' t shake loose ...
all my buddies faces are still young .
and the thing is , the more years i have , the more they' ve lost .
and it' s not always buddies faces that i see , sometime they' re german faces .
near the end we were shootin ' moon faced boys .
i was a sniper .
where i grew up , you learned how to shoot to hunt food .
they' d post me up front .
darn near ahead of the lines .
and i' d sit ... forever .
it' s an amazing thing what you can see while you' re sittin ' .
i' d look for the officers , the radio guys or artillery spotter .
sometime i' d spot a gun nest by the smoke and i' d fire into it .
sometime it wasjust a movement in the woods .
we had a scout , a little fella ... name of kotz .
he was a polish boy from milwaukee .
he' d always take recon and he was darn good at it .
we went by his word and he saved our skin many a time .
he was a little fella ...
we' d broken out of the hedgerows ...
we were makin ' a run across the open and we come upon a woods .
we started drawin ' fire .
i took my usual position ... and i saw somethin ' movin ' , real slow like .
i waited ten minutes , it moved again and i shot .
the movement stopped .
the next day we found kotz ... head shot .
he' d been workin ' his way back toward our lines .
everyone in the unit thought a german sniper had taken him ...
everyone , all these years .
everyone but me .
ha ha !
see , harald ... brainiac ...
got the mower assembly free with this here little old wrench ...
you said it wouldn' t work .
i' d say it worked pretty good .
wouldn' t you ?
so help me slide her out .
we can get settled up .
uh ... i got parts and labour that add up to $247 . 80 .
well , i' d say that' s a little heavy for light work .
don' t you think ?
i' ve got an old man' s eyes , but , ah ...
i' m noticin ' some new tyre here .
well , now ... ah , we got those off a resell , but the treads are good !
well , friend , are you chargin ' me for good or for new ?
ahhhh ... thorvald ?
ahh ... we can make an adjustment there .
well , i think the adjustment should be about thirty dollars .
is that what your pencil' s sayin ' ?
and , ah ... about the labour ...
i appreciate that you boys have done some real time on this ... of course , a man' s gotta ask when he' s workin ' with twins especially a bickerin ' pair how much workin ' was fightin ' ?
he got that right .
shut up , danny .
if i was to judge by thisjoyous affair i saw today ,
i would calculate maybe 20 per cent taken off the labour .
anything else , mister ?
well , i' m not from these parts , but where i come from ,
i would say that that was a little rich for iowa oil .
take the oil , no charge .
well , that' s a splendid offer and i do appreciate it .
what' s the tally ?
ah ... ahhh ...
hundred and eighty even ?
done .
thanks to you boys , i' m gonna get this rig back on the road .
i' ve drove it all the way across iowa and i' m hopin ' it holds on till i get to wisconsin .
my brother lives there .
i haven' t seen him in ten years .
there' s no one knows your life better than a brother that' s near your age .
he knows who and what you are better than anyone on earth .
my brother and i said some ... unforgivable things the last time we met , but , i' m tryin ' to put that behind me .
and this trip is a hard swallow ... of my pride ,
i just hope i' m not too late .
a brother' s a brother .
well , ...
guess i' il be turnin ' in .
i' il , ah ... see you in the morning , then , before you go .
i' m gonna leave awful early .
i wanna thank you for your kindness to a stranger .
it' s been a genuine pleasure havin ' you here , alvin .
write to us , sometime .
i will .
i noticed your campfire .
i brought you some dinner ...
mashed potatoes , meat loaf .
well , thank you kindly .
i' ve had my dinner , but would you join me for a while ?
sure .
thank you .
i hope you don' t mind me trespassin ' .
oh , no , not at all .
made a fine choice .
you' re camped next to one of the oldest cemeteries in the midwest .
french catholic trappers .
the marquette party .
two of his men .
i couldn' t help but notice the rather unusual mode of transport .
well , you' re not the first person to notice that , padre .
my eyes are bad .
i can' t drive .
i don' t like someone else drivin ' the bus , and i need to get to my brother' s .
fair enough .
where is he ?
well , he' s so close , i can practically feel him .
mount zion .
what' s his name ?
lyle straight .
is he that fella that came in with a stroke some weeks ago ?
do you know him ?
i work at the hospital in boscobel .
i remember him comin ' in .
caught my attention because ... he lives in my parish .
well , he' s a baptist .
oh , i believe he told me that .
told me a few things , matter of fact , but he didn' t mention having a brother .
well , neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time .
so , you saw him ?
is he all right ?
i only saw him that once and i haven' t heard anything more .
well , lyle and i grew up as close as brothers could be .
we were raised on a farm in moorhead , minnesota .
we worked hard .
my mom and dad darn near killed themselves tryin ' to make that farm work .
and me and lyle would make games out of our chores .
we' d dream up somethin ' about racin ' and wagerin ' do anything to keep our mind off the cold .
lord , it was cold .
he and i used to sleep out in the yard every summer night , if it wasn' t pourin ' .
nine months of winter , we couldn' t get enough summer .
we' d bunk down when the sun went down .
we' d talk to each other until we went to sleep .
we' d talk about the stars and whether there might be somebody else like us out in space , places we wanted to go and ... it made our trials seem smaller .
yeah , we pretty much talked each other through growin ' up .
oh , whatever happened between you two ?
story as old as the bible .
cain and abel .
anger , vanity .
you mix that together with liquor , and ... you' ve got two brothers who haven' t spoken in ten years .
well , whatever it was that made me and lyle so mad ... don' t matter any more .
i wanna make peace .
i wanna sit with him ,
look up at the stars ...
like we used to do ... so long ago .
well , sir ...
i say " amen " to that .
howdy .
i haven' t had a drink in a lot of years .
now i' m gonna have me a beer .
what flavour ?
what does a miller' s lite taste like ?
there you go .
how' s it taste ?
it' s good .
keep the change .
thank you .
it' s an interesting rig you got outside .
get up the hill ok ?
that hill and 200 more just like it .
how far did ya come ?
from iowa .
i' m headed for lyle straight' s place .
iowa !
my god , you must be thirsty . < <
<
another beer ?
this will do me fine .
i wonder could you point me to lyle' s place ?
i haven' t seen him in an awful long time .
well , you just ... ah , cross 61 here , on " w " ,
take " w " on down to weed road and then on to remington road .
on your right will be lyle' s place .
if he' s there that is .
how you doin ' ... ?
not too good .
this thing' sjust tired .
is there anything i can do to help you ?
well , i don' t know .
itjust quit on me .
why don' t you try her again ?
i' m headin ' to lyle straight' s place .
lyle !
lyle ?
alvin ?
sit down , alvin .
did you ride that thing all the way out here to see me ?
i did , lyle .
