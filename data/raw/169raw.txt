in her heart , your mother knew you' d be hunted all your life .
that you' d never escape your fate .
the skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings ... ... but only you have the power to wield it .
i do not want that power .
i have never wanted it .
you are the last of that bloodline .
there is no other .
my old sword !
sting .
here , take it .
take it .
it' s so light .
yes .
made by the elves , you know .
the blade glows blue when orcs are close .
and it' s times like that , my lad , when you have to be extra careful .
here' s a pretty thing .
mithril .
as light as a feather , and as hard as dragon scales .
let me see you put it on .
come on .
my old ring .
i should very much like ... ... to hold it again , one last time .
i' m sorry i brought this upon you , my boy .
i' m sorry that you must carry this burden .
i' m sorry for everything .
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom .
on you who travel with him , no oath ... ... nor bond is laid to go further than you will .
farewell .
hold to your purpose .
may the blessings of elves and men ... ... and all free folk go with you .
the fellowship awaits the ring bearer .
mordor , gandalf , is it left or right ?
left .
we must hold to this course , west of the misty mountains , for 40 days .
if our luck holds , the gap of rohan will still be open to us .
from there , our road turns east to mordor .
two , one , five .
good !
very good .
move your feet .
you look good , pippin .
thanks .
faster !
if anyone was to ask for my opinion , which i note they' re not ... ... i' d say we were taking the long way ' round .
gandalf , we could pass through the mines of moria .
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome .
no , i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice .
sorry !
get him !
for the shire !
hold him .
hold him down , merry !
gentlemen , that' s enough .
you' ve got my arm !
you' ve got my arm !
what is that ?
nothing .
it' s just a wisp of cloud .
it' s moving fast .
against the wind .
crebain from dunland !
hide !
hurry !
take cover !
spies of saruman .
the passage south is being watched .
we must take the pass of caradhras .
frodo !
boromir .
it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt ... ... over so small a thing .
such a little thing .
boromir !
give the ring to frodo .
as you wish .
i care not .
so , gandalf , you try to lead them over caradhras .
and if that fails , where then will you go ?
if the mountain defeats you ... ... will you risk a more dangerous road ?
there is a fell voice on the air .
it' s saruman !
he' s trying to bring down the mountain !
gandalf , we must turn back !
no !
we must get off the mountain !
make for the gap of rohan , and take the west road to my city !
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard !
we cannot pass over a mountain .
let us go under it .
let us go through the mines of moria .
moria .
you fear to go into those mines .
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep .
you know what they awoke
shadow and flame .
let the ring bearer decide .
we cannot stay here !
this will be the death of the hobbits .
frodo ?
we will go through the mines .
so be it .
frodo , come and help an old man .
how is your shoulders ?
better than it was .
and the ring ?
you feel its power growing , don' t you ?
i' ve felt it too .
you must be careful now .
evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship .
and , i fear , from within .
who then do i trust ?
you must trust yourself .
trust your own strengths .
what do you mean ?
there are many powers in this world ... ... for good or for evil .
some are greater than i am .
and against some i have not yet been tested .
the walls ... ... of moria .
dwarf doors are invisible when closed .
yes , gimli , their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten .
why doesn' t that surprise me ?
well , let' s see .
ithildin .
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight .
it reads , " the doors of durin , lord of moria .
speak , friend , and enter .
what do you suppose that means ?
it' s simple .
if you are a friend , you speak the password and the doors will open .
nothing' s happening .
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves ... ... men and orcs .
what are you going to do , then ?
knock your head against these doors , peregrin took !
and if that does not shatter them ... ... and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions ... ... i will try to find the opening words .
mines are no place for a pony .
even one so brave as bill .
bye bye , bill .
go on , bill .
go on .
don' t worry , sam , he knows the way home .
do not disturb the water .
oh , it' s useless .
it' s a riddle .
speak ' friend ' and enter .
what' s the elvish word for " friend " ?
mellon .
soon , master elf , you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves .
roaring fires , malt beer , ripe meat off the bone !
this , my friend , is the home of my cousin balin .
and they call it a mine .
a mine !
this is no mine .
it' s a tomb .
no ....
no !
goblins .
we make for the gap of rohan .
we should never have come here .
now , get out of here .
get out !
frodo !
help !
strider !
help !
get off him !
aragorn !
frodo !
into the mines !
ligulas !
into the cave !
run !
we now have but one choice .
we must face the long dark of moria .
be on your guard .
there are older and fouler things than orcs ... ... in the deep places of the world .
quietly now .
it' s a four day journey to the other side .
let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed .
the wealth of moria was not in gold ... ... or jewels ... ... but mithril .
bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him .
oh , that was a kingly gift .
yes .
i never told him ... ... but its worth was greater than the value of the shire .
pippin .
i have no memory of this place .
are we lost ?
no .
i think we are .
gandalf' s thinking .
merry ?
what ?
i' m hungry .
there' s something down there .
it' s gollum .
gollum ?
he' s been following us for three days .
he escaped the dungeons of barad dur ?
escaped ... ... or was set loose .
now the ring has brought him here .
he will never be rid of his need for it .
he hates and loves the ring , as he hates and loves himself .
smeagol' s life is a sad story .
yes , smeagol he was once called .
before the ring found him .
before it drove him mad .
it' s a pity bilbo didn' t kill him when he had the chance .
pity ?
it is pity that stayed bilbo' s hand .
many that live deserve death .
some that die deserve life .
can you give it to them , frodo ?
do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment .
even the very wise cannot see all ends .
my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet , for good or ill ... ... before this is over .
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many .
i wish the ring had never come to me .
i wish none of this had happened .
so do all who live to see such times .
but that is not for them to decide .
all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us .
there are other forces at work in this world , frodo , besides the will of evil .
bilbo was meant to find the ring .
in which case , you also were meant to have it .
and that is an encouraging thought .
it' s that way .
he' s remembered .
no .
but the air doesn' t smell so foul down here .
if in doubt , meriadoc , always follow your nose .
let me risk a little more light .
behold ... ... the great realm and dwarf city of dwarrowdelf .
there' s an eye opener , and no mistake .
gimi !
no !
oh , no .
no .
here lies balin ... ... son of fundin ... ... lord of moria .
he is dead , then .
it' s as i feared .
we must move on .
we cannot linger .
they have taken the bridge and the second hall .
we have barred the gates ... ... but cannot hold them for long .
the ground shakes .
drums ... ... drums in the deep .
we cannot get out .
a shadow moves in the dark .
we cannot get out .
they are coming .
fool of a took !
throw yourself in next time , and rid us of your stupidity .
frodo !
orcs .
get back !
stay close to gandalf !
they have a cave troll .
let them come !
there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath .
i think i' m getting the hang of this .
frodo !
aragorn !
aragorn !
frodo !
frodo !
oh , no .
he' s alive .
i' m all right .
i' m not hurt .
you should be dead .
that spear would have skewered a wild boar .
i think there' s more to this hobbit than meets the eye .
mithril .
you are full of surprises , master baggins .
to the bridge of khazad dum !
this way !
what is this new devilry ?
a balrog .
a demon of the ancient world .
this foe is beyond any of you .
run !
quickly !
gandalf .
lead them on , aragorn .
the bridge is near .
do as i say !
swords are no more use here .
gandalf !
merry !
pippin !
sam !
nobody tosses a dwarf .
not the beard !
steady .
hold on !
hang on !
lean forward !
steady .
come on !
now !
over the bridge !
fly !
you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i am a servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
the dark fire will not avail you , flame of udun !
go back to the shadow .
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools !
no !
aragorn !
legolas , get them up .
give them a moment , for pity' s sake !
by nightfall , these hills will be swarming with orcs .
we must reach the woods of lothlorien .
come , boromir .
legolas .
gimli , get them up .
on your feet , sam .
frodo ?
frodo !
stay close , young hobbits !
they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods .
an elf witch ... ... of terrible power .
all who look upon her ... ... fall under her spell .
frodo !
and are never seen again .
your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom .
you bring great evil here , ring bearer .
mr. frodo ?
well , here' s one dwarf she won' t ensnare so easily .
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox .
the dwarf breathes so loud , we could have shot him in the dark .
so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves !
speak words we can all understand !
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days .
and you know what this dwarf says to that ?
that was not so courteous .
you bring great evil with you .
you can go no further .
gandalf' s death was not in vain .
nor would he have you give up hope .
you carry a heavy burden , frodo .
don' t carry the weight of the dead .
you will follow me .
cares galeton .
the heart of envenom on earth .
realm of the lord celeborn and of galadriel , lady of light .
the enemy knows you have entered here .
what hope you had in secrecy is now gone .
eight there are here , yet nine there were set out from rivendell .
tell me , where is gandalf ?
for i much desire to speak with him .
i can no longer see him from afar .
gandalf the grey did not pass the borders of this land .
he has fallen into shadow .
he was taken by both shadow and flame .
a balrog of morgoth .
for we went needlessly into the net of moria .
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life .
we do not yet know his full purpose .
do not let the great emptiness of khazad dum fill your heart ... ... gimli , son of gloin .
for the world has grown full of peril ... ... and in all lands ... ... love is now mingled with grief .
what now becomes of this fellowship ?
without gandalf , hope is lost .
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife .
stray but a little and it will fail ... ... to the ruin of all .
yet hope remains while the company is true .
do not let your hearts be troubled .
go now and rest ... ... for you are weary with sorrow and much toil .
tonight , you will sleep ....
welcome , frodo of the shire ... ... one who has seen the eye !
a lament for gandalf .
what do they say about him ?
i have not the heart to tell you .
for me , the grief is still too near .
i bet they don' t mention his fireworks .
there should be a verse about them .
the finest rockets ever seen
they burst in stars of blue and green
or after thunder , silver showers
came falling like a rain of flowers
oh , that doesn' t do them justice by a long road .
take some rest .
these borders are well protected .
i will find no rest here .
i heard her voice inside my head .
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor .
she said to me , " even now there is hope left .
but i cannot see it .
it is long since we had any hope .
my father is a noble man .
but his rule is failing ... ... and our people lose faith .
he looks to me to make things right , and i would do it .
i would see the glory of gondor restored .
have you ever seen it , aragorn ?
the white tower of ecthelion .
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver .
its banners caught high in the morning breeze .
have you ever been called home ... ... by the clear ringing of silver trumpets ?
i have seen the white city ... ... long ago .
one day , our paths will lead us there .
the lords of gondor have returned .
will you look into the mirror ?
what will i see ?
even the wisest cannot tell .
for the mirror ... ... shows many things .
things that were ... ... things that are ... ... and some things ...
... that have not yet come to pass .
i know what it is you saw .
for it is also in my mind .
it is what will come to pass if you should fail .
the fellowship is breaking .
it is already begun .
he will try to take the ring .
you know of whom i speak .
one by one , it will destroy them all .
if you ask it of me ... ...
i will give you the one ring .
you offer it to me freely .
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this .
in place of a dark lord , you would have a queen ... ... not dark but beautiful , and terrible as the dawn !
treacherous as the sea !
stronger than the foundations of the earth !
all shall love me ... ... and despair .
i pass the test .
i will diminish ... ... and go into the west ...
... and remain galadriel .
i cannot do this alone .
you are a ring bearer , frodo .
to bear a ring of power ... ... is to be alone .
this is nenya , the ring of adamant .
and i am its keeper .
this task was appointed to you .
and if you do not find a way ... ... no one will .
then i know what i must do .
it' s just ...
... i' m afraid to do it .
even the smallest person can change the course of the future .
do you know how the orcs first came into being ?
they were elves once .
taken by the dark powers ... ... tortured and mutilated .
a ruined and terrible form of life .
and now ... ... perfected .
my fighting uruk hai ... ... whom do you serve ?
saruman !
hunt them down .
do not stop until , they are found .
you do not know pain .
you do not know fear .
you will taste man flesh !
one of the halflings carries something of great value .
bring them to me alive and unspoiled .
kill the others .
never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people .
may these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes .
lembas .
elvish waybread .
one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man .
how many did you eat ?
four .
every league you travel south , the danger will increase .
mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the anduin .
nor will you find safety on the western bank .
strange creatures bearing the white hand have been seen on our borders .
seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun , yet these have done so .
by river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of rauros .
my gift for you , legolas , is a bow of the galadhrim .
worthy of the skill of our woodland kin .
these are the daggers of the noldorin .
they have already seen service in war .
do not fear , young peregrin took .
you will find your courage .
and for you , samwise gamgee ... ... elven rope made of hithlain .
thank you , my lady .
have you run out of those nice , shiny daggers ?
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves ?
nothing .
except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time ... ... for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth .
actually ....
there was one thing .
no , no , i couldn' t .
it' s quite impossible .
stupid to ask .
i have nothing greater to give ... ... than the gift you already bear .
that choice is yet before her .
you have your own choice to make , aragorn .
to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil ... ... or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin .
farewell , frodo baggins .
i give you the light of earendil ... ... our most beloved star .
may it be a light for you in dark places ... ... when all other lights go out .
i have taken my worst wound at this parting ... ... having looked my last upon that which is fairest .
henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me .
what was her gift ?
i asked her for one hair from her golden head .
she gave me three .
gollum .
he has tracked us since moria .
i had hoped we would lose him on the river .
but he' s too clever a waterman .
and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts ... ... it will make the crossing even more dangerous .
have some food , mr. frodo .
no , sam .
you haven' t eaten anything all day .
you' re not sleeping , neither .
don' t think i haven' t noticed .
mr. frodo  i' m all right .
but you' re not .
i' m here to help you .
i promised gandalf that i would .
you can' t help me , sam .
not this time .
get some sleep .
minas tirith is the safer road .
you know that .
from there we can regroup .
strike out for mordor from a place of strength .
there is no strength in gondor that can avail us .
you were quick enough to trust the elves .
have you so little faith in your own people ?
yes , there is weakness .
there is frailty .
but there is courage also , and honor to be found in men .
but you will not see that .
you are afraid !
all your life , you have hidden in the shadows .
scared of who you are , of what you are .
i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city .
frodo .
the argonath .
long have i desired to look upon the kings of old .
my kin .
we cross the lake at nightfall .
hide the boats and continue on foot .
we approach mordor from the north .
oh , yes ?
just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil ... ... an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks .
and after that , it gets even better .
festering , stinking marshland as far as the eye can see .
that is our road .
i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength , master dwarf .
recover my
we should leave now .
no .
orcs patrol the eastern shore .
we must wait for cover of darkness .
it is not the eastern shore that worries me .
a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind .
something draws near .
i can feel it .
recover strength ?
pay no heed to that , young hobbit .
where' s frodo ?
none of us should wander alone .
you , least of all .
so much depends on you .
frodo ?
i know why you seek solitude .
you suffer .
i see it day by day .
you sure you do not suffer needlessly ?
there are other ways , frodo .
other paths that we might take .
i know what you would say .
it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart .
warning ?
against what ?
we' re all afraid , frodo .
but to let that fear drive us , to destroy what hope we have ...
... don' t you see that is madness ?
there is no other way .
i ask only for the strength to defend my people !
if you would but lend me the ring .
no .
why do you recoil ?
i am no thief .
you are not yourself .
what chance do you think you have ?
they will find you .
they will take the ring .
and you will beg for death before the end !
you fool !
it is not yours , save by unhappy chance !
it could have been mine .
it should be mine !
give it to me !
give it to me !
no !
give it to me !
no .
i see your mind .
you will take the ring to sauron !
you will betray us !
you' il go to your death , and the death of us all !
curse you !
curse you and all the halflings !
frodo ?
frodo .
what have i done ?
please , frodo .
frodo , i' m sorry !
frodo ?
it has taken boromir .
where is the ring ?
stay away !
frodo !
i swore to protect you .
can you protect me from yourself ?
would you destroy it ?
aragorn .
aragorn .
elessar .
i would have gone with you to the end .
into the very fires of mordor .
i know .
look after the others .
especially sam .
he will not understand .
go , frodo !
run .
run !
mr. frodo !
find the halfling !
find the halfling !
elendil !
aragorn , go !
frodo !
hide here .
quick !
come on !
what' s he doing ?
he' s leaving .
no !
pippin !
run , frodo .
go on !
hey !
hey , you !
over here !
over here !
this way !
it' s working !
i know it' s working !
run !
the horn of gondor .
boromir .
run !
no .
they took the little ones .
hold still .
frodo .
where is frodo ?
i let frodo go .
then you did what i could not .
i tried to take the ring from him .
the ring is beyond our reach now .
forgive me .
i did not see it .
i have failed you all .
no , boromir .
you fought bravely .
you have kept your honor .
leave it .
it is over .
the world of men will fall .
and all will come to darkness ... ... and my city to ruin .
i do not know what strength is in my blood ... ... but i swear to you , i will not let the white city fall ... ... nor our people fail .
our people .
our people .
i would have followed you , my brother .
my captain .
my king .
be at peace ... ... son of gondor .
they will look for his coming from the white tower .
but he will not return .
frodo !
i wish the ring had never come to me .
i wish none of this had happened .
so do all who live to see such times ... ... but that is not for them to decide .
all you have to decide ... ... is what to do with the time that is given to you .
frodo , no !
frodo !
mr. frodo !
no , sam .
go back , sam !
i' m going to mordor alone .
of course you are .
and i' m coming with you !
you can' t swim !
sam !
sam !
i made a promise , mr. frodo .
don' t you leave him , samwise gamgee .
and i don' t mean to .
i don' t mean to .
sam .
come on .
hurry !
frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore .
you mean not to follow them .
frodo' s fate is no longer in our hands .
then it has all been in vain .
the fellowship has failed .
not if we hold true to each other .
we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death .
not while we have strength left .
leave all that can be spared behind .
we travel light .
let us hunt some orc .
yes !
mordor .
i hope the others find a safer road .
strider will look after them .
i don' t suppose we' il ever see them again .
we may yet , mr. frodo .
we may .
sam ...
... i' m glad you are with me .
