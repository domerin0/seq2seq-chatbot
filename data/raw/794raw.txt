yes .
he must know about zebraman .
hey , did you ever hear anything strange from the professor' s room ?

too bad .
i think kyoto knows what' s going on .
i think kyoto is in alien hands .
who told you that ?
wait a sec !
find him .
yes .
in yokohama , 34 years ago , a ufo crash landed .
the aliens mixed in with humans around the area of the junior high school .
soon after , the alien' s began using the zebraman scripts for their plans .
the program was cancelled early .
the ufo aliens used the junior high school to further their plans .
they began to further experiment on humans .
prof. kyoto began a one man fight against the aliens .
that' s why he wanted to transfer the students to another school .
he said ...
what ?
anything goes .
he believed ...
dreams come true .
kyoto is an alien .
but not just a normal alien .
he' s an original alien from the ufo .
hey .
yes ?
we can' t let you interfere with our plans for invasion ...
seigawa ...
seigawa san is dead .
i need a bike .
i should have a bike .
heroes always have bikes .
sorry .
kazuki ...
your father ...
needs to fly to the sky ...
sorry .
your mother ...
and sister ...
take care of them .
dad ...
do your best .
did you read the script for the final episode ?
no .
how about asano kun ?
he didn' t read it either .
that' s good .
i don' t think i can fly .
when fighting the alien boss ,
zebraman
gets defeated .
but then ...
what happens ?
zebraman ...
flies into the sky .
then he ... saves the earth and humanity ...
from the alien invasion .
that' s the final episode .
what the heck is that ?
who would watch such a show ?
you' ve been practicing flying ?
yes .
how long ?
10 days .
i think to fly ...
is impossible .
i wish i never read that script !
my son believes in you .
he believes that zebraman will protect the earth .
for my son' s sake ...
please ...
learn how to fly !
miss ...
yes .
did you ... understand my story ?
yes .
there is one man who can help .
who is it ?
it' s zebraman .
it' s zebraman !

sounds weird , doesn' t it ?
but i think he' s the only one who can help us .
no need .
the order has been given .
tonight , the junior high school will be no more .
our operation will be over .
in a moment , the school will cease to exist .
i expect your support .
how can you say that ?
everyone has gone crazy .
it' s all we can do to survive .
dad ...
do your best .
he believes .
believes in dreams .
believe in dreams , believe in dreams .
why did you come here ?
if something bad happened tell me ...
no , no .
i had something important to tell you .
you should not give up .
i really believe that you are a big hero , defending the earth .
you look terrible .
