come on , man .
come on .
let it go !
bring it on !
yeah !
see you .
come on , man .
oh , i' m scared .
come on , man !
chill , man !
let it go .
it' s not worth it .
hey , boys from beantown , why don' t you say hello to billy buckner !
okay , i' m in .
yeah , the same thing with you , right ?
come on .
what' s going on ?
we' re getting out of here .
what happened to these guys ?
bad sushi .
this is a joke , right ?
these are the guys she wants as her co stars ?
actually , just walt .
he' s the one in the white jacket .
i don' t get it .
oh , i do .
you see , cher thinks she' s being slick .
isn' t that right , howard ?
she' s trying to force us to pull the plug on the show .
no , come on , terry !
hey , look at me .
i swear on my kids , it' s got nothing to do with that .
well , i got a message for cher .
tell her we start shooting first thing monday morning .
what kind of deal you looking for ?
basically , it' s the same deal i got for kitty carlisle in what' s my line ?
twelve hundred and fifty dollars ?
per show .
and that' s not all .
he gets his own dressing room with a star ... ... and a fresh pot of coffee every morning .
and none of that cheap stuff .
folgers crystals .
that' s very doable .
what are we looking for on the back end ?
you mean the brother ?
bob doesn' t really act .
how about 50 bucks a week and his own dressing room ?
hi , are you attorney honey garret ?
who' s asking ?
oh , i' m terribly sorry .
name' s mack beasley .
i understand your law firm is looking for a crime scene detective .
all right , mr. beasley , you have five minutes .
well , i appreciate you taking the time .
this is quite an office you work out of .
yes , i know .
so ....
well , mr. beasley , what are your qualifications ?
well , i' m a rhodes scholar .
i have a ph. d. in bio analysis .
i trained with the navy seals for , let' s see , seven years ... ... and i won the heisman trophy .
twice .
well , here , fill this out ... ... and i' il see if i can squeeze you into an entry level position .
fantastic .
let me tell you , you won' t regret this .
if you need any references or anything ... ... i can certainly furnish you with everything that
bob , bob , bob , you' re killing me .
you' re really cut it .
cut it .
ten .
that' s 10 times .
please , let' s go .
it' s okay .
it' s just very , very important that you stay on your mark .
yeah , i' m just i am a little nervous .
i have some opening day jitters .
it' s okay , kid .
it' s just , you have to stay out of frame .
okay ?
otherwise , the whole show won' t work .
all right ?
griffin , back home at the oak bluffs playhouse ... ... we used to disguise him as different props .
right .
great idea , we' il turn bob into a bush .
it might not be such a bad idea .
it is a terrible idea !
the network has made it very clear that the kid stays out of the picture .
and this way we don' t have to explain why the beaze is followed by a bush .
still gotta explain the sucky dialogue .
hey , hey , hey .
i' m sorry , bob , do you now have a problem with the script ?
no , no , no , the script is awesome , sir .
it' s just the dialogue .
i mean , every guy knows that archie griffin' s the only guy ...
... who won the heisman twice .
archie who ?
hey , bob , just cool it , okay ?
he didn' t mean it .
the kid' s right .
this script sucks .
griffin , come here .
why don' t we just give bob a chance to write the script ?
yeah , right .
bob , you ever written for television ?
no .
see how perfect this is ?
we can get rid of the old hacks ... ... that wrote this crap , get some fresh blood .
are you suggesting that we bring in the bush ...
yeah . ... to punch up the script ?
look , you gotta go with me on this .
i got a good feeling about this guy .
i don' t believe this .
i just l
all right , everybody , that' s , you know , that' s a wrap .
okay , folks , that' s a wrap !
congratulations ...
... you' re the new head writer .
thanks .
cher !
cher !
no , no .
no !
ls your throat sore ?
are you achy ?
i' m just feeling a little run down .
i was up all night studying lines with walt , so that' s probably what did it .
is that why he got you the big teddy bear ?
yeah .
he really went overboard this time .
now , get some rest .
and i' il see you tomorrow .
okay .
thanks for the " neo tu tong .
bye bye .
jeez , i thought she' d never leave .
i am a terrible person .
i don' t know why you' re doing this .
why don' t you just tell her ?
you' re right .
the time has come .
you know ?
by the way , i gotta give you some credit for bringing moe on as a writer .
he' s really given the beaze character some dignity , you know ?
i don' t want to be an actor who takes a role and ends up looking like an ass .
know what i mean ?
i just can' t believe this .
it' s like a miracle .
it' s not a miracle .
walt' s a great actor .
yeah , but bob can' t act .
how are they gonna pull this off ?
hush .
it' s starting .
hey !
watch the show , you dumb shit !
miss garret , there' s a mack beasley here to see you ,
i don ' t know any mack beasley , get rid of him ,
i' m sorry , i told him not to  are you honey garret ?
just who the hell do you think you are , barging in here ?
i figured i had a right ,
according to this cocktail napkin , i' m half owner of this law firm ,
where did you get this ?
won it off a drunk at a poker game ,
that drunk happens to be my ex husband ,
i can see what drove him to the bottle , you son of a
i meant losing a beautiful squaw like you would drive any man to the firewater ,
you see that ?
that was bob .
where ?
he was right there .
you got farts in your head .
l ' m telling you , i saw his nose !
i' il keep this ,,,,
there he is again .
it is his honker !
yeah , that' s him .
that' s him .
oh , my , bob looks very good .
he' s lost a little weight and he nice tan .
with chromakey , the camera picks up every color except for blue .
to the audience at home , you don' t exist .
hey , bob , put your mask down .
check it out .
wow .
i look incredible .
look at that .
what the hell is this ?
oh , we' re giving walt a chance to spread his wings .
well , he was doing just fine before .
well , now he' il do even finer .
barney .
check out what i' m doing to cher' s butt .
hey .
you like that , huh ?
put some junk in her trunk .
can i talk to you in private ?
sure , cher .
don' t you realize how morally repugnant and politically incorrect it is ... ... to hide walt' s god given siamese ness ?
your concern is very touching , cher , but let' s live in the real world .
america isn' t ready for that .
besides , bob doesn' t want to act .
i just don' t believe bob should be cut out .
we do .
you seen today' s trades ?
despite its generic title , honey and the beaze should generate solid buzz .
with snappy writing that pokes fun at an all too familiar genre ...
... show deserves to find an audience .
hey !
newcomer walt tenor' s inspired turn as cocky but sensitive ... ... biochemist mack beasley more than compensates for a lackluster perf ... ... by cher and indifferent direction by actor turned helmer griffin dunne .
tech credits are run of the mill .
it' s a rave , guys !
great .
son of a gun .
this baby may just make it .
oh , excuse me , miss cher .
there' s a few fans outside hoping for autographs .
all right , but i' m not taking any pictures .
no , no , no  what' s this ?
shit , it' s just cher .
sorry , i should have specified .
they' re looking for walt .
seen him ?
hey , lady , can you go get the beaze for us ?
we want beaze !
we want beaze !
we want beaze !
hey .
you wouldn' t happen to know if bob was alone , would you ?
i highly doubt it .
okay .
bob ?
hello ?
i' ve got a surprise for mr. sick in bed .
oh .
i' m sorry .
i was looking for bob .
what ?
what ?
may ?
oh , my god .
you' re not brothers , you
no , may , no !
it' s not what you think !
may !
may , wait !
wait !
may !
it' s not what you think .
listen to me .
i don' t have to listen to anything .
i have eyes !
well , then use them .
oh , my god .
please ... ... don' t go .
i wonder what she' s got under that hood .
i' m really sorry , bob .
it' s not your fault .
don' t worry .
she' il be back .
where else is she gonna find a guy like you ?
i don' t know .
chernobyl ?
don' t worry , boys .
we' re gonna hit this thing head on .
what thing ?
someone ratted you out , boys .
it' s gonna be all over the 5 : 00 news .
cronkite' s gonna have a field day with this .
in the wake of the startling revelation that walt tenor ,,, ,,, of honey and the beaze is a conjoined twin ,,, ,,, sponsors are running for the hills ,
let' s get out of here before johnny press comes sniffing around .
come on .
what are you waiting for ?
we stand firmly by our decision to hire mr. tenor .
sadly , the realities of our business template are such ... ... that with the loss of our sponsors ... ... we are forced to halt production until further notice .
we will , however , run the final three episodes , as scheduled .
here' s the plan .
we' re gonna canvass all 48 states with denials .
now , i' m giving you the same advice i gave hudson in ' 56 .
deny , deny , deny .
right .
deny what ?
that there' s two of you where one should be .
i got a better idea .
who asked you , trixie ?
these are my clients .
they' il do as i say .
wait , what' s your idea ?
hey , hey , hey , what is this , a minute iny ?
it' s really simple .
don' t " deny , deny , deny .
embrace .

this is about how you feel .
you' re the one who couldn' t tell her the truth .
