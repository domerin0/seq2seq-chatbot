i just bought that car , you wanker .
what is in you that is so hot ?
then what , sgt. anders ?
then , for the fifth time , the shit bag kidnapped me ... stole my car , and trashed at least two cruisers ... motorcycles , and god knows what else !
then , he just let you go ?
what are you hiding , huh , anders ?
i could hide my foot up your
sgt. anders is cooperating fully , i see .
does she belong to you ?
maj. wilson , u. s. embassy .
good .
maybe you can tell me why , of all people , your sgt. anders ... happened to be visiting from a nato base three hours away ... and conveniently buys a coffee in the street , an american robs 20 casinos ... a priceless case ...
that`s hardly a reason  ... shoots a cop ... then your sgt. anders drives him away , oh , and gives him a gun .
captain , sgt. anders has been in the military police department for two years .
i can assure you , she is not  look .
it was an inside job .
i don`t think our guy is the killer .
he saved my life , sir .
and you are so grateful that you drove him away with $65 million case .
sgt. anders , would you step outside , please ?
excuse me .
you have some jurisdiction here ?
are we under military command ?
i know you guys are invading all over romania .
should i salute ?
capt. szabo , you did call in a nato bomb squad .
and you are illegally detaining a british citizen .
report to lts .
tool and banner .
don`t go too far , anders .
new uniform or is it casual day today , sergeant ?
i didn`t get the memo .
fun joy ride , sgt. anders ?
spectacular , sir .
gun and car . lmpressive .
did he tip ?
you didn`t drive him , too , did you ?
yeah .
nuts , hopefully .
what do you need , lieutenant ?
photo fit .
check the files to see if he comes up in a mug shot in american , european databases .
the guy was a pro .
i think it was two gangs , one hitting the other .
sgt. anders , i have spoken with your superior officer in costanza .
the only pro you`ve ever seen fixed the copier in your office .
leave the detection work to us .
do i need a lawyer , sir ?
you bet your ass .
you two have been assigned a desk , in there .
get to work .
he answered your cell after the robbery ?
yeah , i lost that , too , sir .
hello .
no , l`m sorry , kelly had to step out for a minute .
call back later .
bye bye .
pray to god almighty you do not know this man , sergeant .
you`il face a court martial .
just wanted to make sure we`re clear on that .
anders ?
kelly anders ?
we found your car .
l`m gonna kill that son of a bitch .
what was so difficult ?
the case goes to amsterdam , then to berlin , then you bring it back here to me .
mr. grapini , the depot security wouldn`t let us get
you`re not going to make excuses .
please tell me you`re not going to justify losing the van gogh ...
what my partner was trying to say was ... worth $65 million .
i can give you nothing and ruin your careers ... or i can triple your fee .
find that painting and bring it to me , or destroy it .
i don`t care which .
bargaining chip .
i think you had better pray that tuliver loves you above all things ...
little suza .
yes , sir .
you and your girlfriend packing for a vacation , spanky ?
yeah .
i took the blanks out of this one .
that was good , though .
i must say .
switching ammo and everything .
not me , man .
come on , t , you brought me in on this . ``$20 mil . ``just come meet suza .
suza`s got a plan . ``
and you came back to your apartment ?
spanky , that`s the very first rule .

i was informed that you would be more difficult .
check him .
come on .
spanky style .
what the fuck ?
alexsie kutchinov .
l`m hungry .
eating peas ... has become like climbing the ural mountains .
how much money for a cure ?
nothing .
there is no cure .
lrony always bites you ... in the ankles .
i hate to lose things , spanky .
it is spanky , isn`t it ?
have you any idea how ugly that can make me ?
ugly as a crack ho on smack , daddy ?
tuliver ?
don`t know the cat .
tuliver ... who just made me $20 million ripping off every casino in the city .
l`m on vacation .
i don`t know no tuliver man , dude .
lf you insist on lying to me , spanky ...
i will shoot you .
they will drop you in the river .
now , was it not tuliver ... who killed six of my soldiers in your apartment ?
was it not tuliver who organized the heist ... and stole my case ?
i don`t know zip , p. diddy .
dudes tried to jump up my crib ... and then bam , spanky was out , just like buster douglas .
except for that tyson fight .
okay .
we have a saying in my country .
no .
``the shoe salesman ... ``he never carries shoes . ``

just look , sergeant .
don`t think .
he knew my badge was a military ld .
military ?
back in the box , my little pony .
lt. tool , there was something wrong with the shooting .
so i don`t think he`s the triggerman .
cry me a river .
he`s a cop killer , in my book .
why don`t you clear up a little around here ?
look for your new boyfriend`s face .
unless , of course , you ain`t looking too hard .
steal my phone , too , shit bag ?
sorry .
its habitual .
actually l`m just borrowing it .
i lost mine .
lt`s in the evidence bay . lf you want it , drop by the police station and we`il swap .
okay .
promise you won`t arrest me ?
i promise .
so why were you crashing my party , sgt. anders ?
oh .
i didn`t know i needed an invite ...
capt. jack tuliver , disgraced delta force commando .
38 years old .
shall i go on ?
very good .
so you got a card in the game .
talk to me , tuliver .
everybody else wants you dead .
a police officer was killed in your raid today .
not by me .
l`m about the only one that believes you .
and why would you believe me ?
well , l`ve driven with you , and i survived .
which is more than i can say for my car .
do you know how long it took me to save up for that ?
and i suppose you saved my life .
oh , you`re making me mushy , sgt. anders .
it was another gang that hit you , wasn`t it ?
who ?
yeah , well , when i find out , you`il be the first to know .
any word from your guy ?
couldn`t find their own asses after a crap .
mikhail around ?
get lost .
tell him that tuliver is here .
``$1 . 3 million . `` ``$800, 000 . `` ``$1 . 5 million . ``
where did they get $80 million ?
a $65 million painting ?
now , i wonder what kind of case that would be in , capt. tuliver ?
you shouldn`t have come here .
people want you dead .
you wouldn`t happen to know who`s trying to kill me , would you ?
yeah .
me .
oh , shit .
what did you get bull into , tuliver , huh ?
come on , he came to me .
bullshit !
bull would have come to me for a heist .
his own brother !
he would have been alive now .
bull`s dead because of you .
no , come on !
no .
both of my brothers died around you .
and you are still alive ?
can you explain that to me ?
what ?
i lost 12 guys today .
l`il tell you another thing .
every time one of your brothers died , so did l .
tuliver .
where are you going to go , huh ?
come on .
what are you drinking ?
look .
no guns .
okay ?
come on .
let`s drink .
bull came to me .
he met some girl that worked for an armored car company .
she came to him .
he came to me .
that`s it .
delta force .
``frank `bull` mercea . ``
dorothy !
bull mercea .
buddy of yours , jack ?
what , do you bring your own people in for the job ?
married .
bucharest .
alexsie kutchinov is a very dangerous russian .
he`s put the word out on you .
i could be killed for just talking to you .
a gangster ?
gangster , a thief , drug dealer .
covers it all with nightclubs , art dealership , car dealers ... you name it .
lf there is money to be made in this town ... you can be sure he`s got a hand in it .
he`s got a friend of mine .
who ?
the girl .
jack !
never let a woman get into your business , jack .
tully .
crazy as a shit house rat .
l`ve always wondered what my brothers saw in you .
both so determined to become american citizens .
for what ?
even worse , that bull should organize a heist ... and not tell me .
lt`s nothing personal , mik .
stay here tonight .
andre will take you to a safer place in the morning .
hi .
l`m sorry to drag you out so early , mr. grapini .
anything to help .
please .
so , you found an original van gogh .
thats correct , isnt it ?
hiemler`s lily .
hiemler`s lily ?
i bought a consignment of paintings ... from a cousin of hiemler , alfred lindle , a dutch artist .
i always liked his work .
and the bank wanted money for the debts he owed .
they sent me every painting in the house for one price .
the lily was in with them .
i thought it a prank , at first .
well , apparently it is the real thing .
didn`t lindle claim it ?
no .
like the original`s owner , he took his own life .
that poor painting traveled all over europe ... to be authenticated by the insurance company .
it only had one more place to go before i could show it .
now it is a ghost again .
will the insurance cover it ?
it is covered .
but hopefully we`il never have to find out .
what i can trust is that you people can do your job .
can you ?
well , it`s always hard when things are stolen .
young lady , this is not hard .
this is a fucking tragedy .
i was just thinking about you .
couldn`t leave me alone , huh , jack ?
well , l`ve already had my hands down your pants .
figured l`d try for second base , anders .
well , my door`s open .
come on over .
now , what kind of man you take me for ?
a thief in the wrong country .
not a killer ?
convince me .
blanks in the gun .
couldn`t have shot him , even if i wanted to .
now , why would you put blanks in your gun ?
looked like you were shooting when i saw you .
not at the cop .
and i didn`t put blanks in my gun .
turn yourself in .
the evidence will pan out .
you didn`t tell them about me yet , did you ?
what makes you say that ?
my mug shot`s not plastered all over the news .
well , did you mean to steal that case or was that bonus ?
even thieves need to get lucky every now and then .
what are you in this for , anders ?
i want you all for myself .
what`s in the case ?
give me something and l`il give you something .
are we talking about the same thing ?
probably not .
jack , think long and hard about what you want from this relationship ... and then call me .
i will .
l`m starting to like you , anders .
always leave them hanging .
professor .
yes ?
l`m sgt. anders , nato forces , stationed here in bucharest .
hello .
could i ask you a few questions about a painting you were to have authenticated ?
which painting is this ?
a possible lost van gogh .
the lilies in the field ?
the painting is a fake .
lt`s not that i don`t believe you , sir .
how can you be so sure when ... two other reputable art appraisers think it`s real .
to the trained eye ... it`s obvious that the brush strokes were not those of the master .
the painting lacks texture , nuance ... and the familiar pastichal brilliance .
so , it`s forgery ?
yes .
credible attempt , but ... nonetheless ... a forgery .
now , if you`il excuse me , sgt. anders .
nothing personal , tully .
just business .
oh , you cocksucker .
your little job ... has put us all in danger .
this man would be very upset with me ... if i helped you .
mikhail ... who do you think killed bull , huh ?
who do you think ?
so , sore tuliver ... we have a saying in my country : ``don`t blame the baker ... ``when the butcher bakes the bread . ``
what the hell does that mean ?
it means you are fucked .
so , you had no idea what was in the package ?
have you ever done courier work ?
no .
no .
a client pays for a package to be delivered ... we deliver .
and where was it going ?
to the destination .
destination was ... a dr. bostnescu , here in bucharest .
you could be more helpful .
i am .
do you have an armed assault and robbery charge against you ?
acquitted .
and what has that got to do with anything ?
nothing really ... just being thorough .
would hate to think of a man with counts of armed assault against him would have ... any knowledge of a $65 million painting going missing on his watch .
my cell number .
call me if you think of anything useful .
don`t get up .
follow her .
what did he say ?
go with god .
sister fucker .
wake him .
no sleep for the wicked , jack .
there must be something really big in that case .
oh , that`s frightening , tuliver .
you can read minds .
lf l`m dead ... no case .
l`il be just one minute .
make yourself at home .
dorothy !
do you know where jack tuliver is ?
he`s wanted for the murder of a police officer .
jack can kill , but he`s no killer .
grapini ... made this job sound so much easier ... than it turned out .
get someone to steal the casino money .
oops .
$65 million painting ... disappears .
oh , yes .
it is a painting , jack ... and i need that painting .
you see ... it would be very bad for me ... if that painting was to show up ... and everyone realized ... it was a fake .
how will i get my insurance money then ...
jack ?
how many people in this photo will die this week ?
why did jack go to prison ?
you see the other man next to jack ?
constantine was bull`s brother .
they were in the military with jack .
constantine mercea died for his country .
a military officer sent constantine on a suicidal mission .
and he died .
jack broke that officers arm and leg ... then stole a helicopter ... flew into the local town to have a drink to his friends memory .
eight mps were sent to get him .
four ended up in the hospital .
tuliver did four years in leavenworth for that one night .
jack went to jail ... and bull came home .
how did they get into this ?
i don`t know .
it was that girl ...
suza .
suza ?
how was she , tuliver ?
just another girl in another city ?
what would you do for a team member , jack .
are you a team player ?
no !
come on .
you don`t have to do that .
jeez .
she came to bull to set up a job .
it was too big for bull .
so they called in tuliver ?
l`m sorry for your loss .
who is this ?
that`s bull`s other brother , mikhail .
he owns a nightclub .
hello , mikhail .
nice car .
nice new car .
are you an accessory that comes with it ?
funny you should say that .
say what ?
accessory .
jack tuliver`s accessory .
wanna dance ?
suza .
they`re going to kill me .
i can`t do this much longer .
but if i talk , we are dead .
l`m so sorry , jack .
it wasn`t meant to be like this .
it was gonna be so easy .
we were all gonna go to the beach .
spanky sold us down the crapper .
no ... they have him upstairs .
jack ... just tell them .
lf i do , you are dead .
you haven`t heard spanky scream for the last 24 hours .
they are relentless .
l`d sooner die quick with a bullet than like this .
i can`t die like this .
i can`t .
no , i have not seen jack tuliver for a long time .
l`ve seen that man before .
recently ?
he`s in a picture in a house .
standing next to tuliver , who did four years in leavenworth when he died .
now ... if i was jack ... and was in trouble with a gang who busted my heist ... and every policeman in the city thinks i shot a cop ...
i would come here .
so , you think you know jack pretty well ?
how does that happen ?
how does a good looking police officer like you ... give a shit about a dirty bank robber like jack tuliver ?
he`s my alibi .
have you ever met the art dealer from whom ...
grapini gets his art ?
who ?
i should make his acquaintance if i were you .
but take my advice ... have a gun nearby ... when you do .
he`s not as friendly as me .
give me a name .
i see .
thank you .
sergei .
come on .
embarrassing .
you see ... patience .
okay , l`il take you to it .
you think i am stupid man , jack ?
you think a man who would cut his own throat shaving ... could run the largest pugata in this entire shitty country !
cutthroat world ?
stupid man ?
hit him .
no , please .
don`t , please .
look , it`s in a ...
locker in the train station .
the locker has no number .
l`il take you to it .
and why you take me ?
so you can try to escape ?
one of my men here kills you ...
i lose my case .
i hid the key .
``l hid the key`` ?
funny .
l`il tell you what , tuliver .
tomorrow morning ... you will get the key .
and you will bring me my case .
or the penalty ... of her death ... will be so much worse ... than the death itself .
sweet dreams , jack .
no warrant .
nice , kelly .
eastern european art .
acquisitions .
thanks , honey .
pretty , now .
what , you want a date ?
maybe your friend over here might be a better choice .

learned a few bad words , huh ?
get the case , and you can buggerfuck him until sunday .
lf it makes you happy .

i am a man .
i don`t like men .
he makes you angry and you ... act like schoolgirl !
schoolgirl ?
schoolgirl ?
i give you school
i told them it was in my left pocket .
so what makes alexsie kutchinov so interesting , mikhail ?

are you sure she helped him out ?
well , you`il save on dropping the case .
i want that little bitch taken care of .
well , gentlemen .
problems ?

i was wondering what happened to you .
anders , still got those panties on i like ?
l`m wearing just a smile for you , jack .

all of this is for a damn painting ?
well , it better not be one of them sad clown paintings , `cause i hate those things .
talking of sad clowns ... you`re a good looking man , jack .
do you know that ?
gotta go .
what ?
nothing .
always a pleasure , anders .
gotta run .
places to go , people to kill .
hi , jack .
missed you .
what are you doing , stalking me ?
phone sex isn`t illegal in romania .
no ... but armed robbery is .
and if that was sex ... only one of us was satisfied .
boy , do you need a boyfriend .
come with me .
l`m taking applications .
you kill the artist ... buy his paintings and slip it in with them ... threaten the appraisers , maybe even have alexsie kill one .
what was his name again ?
gustav , dr. gustav .
that`s right .
dr. gustav .
i didn`t kill the artist .
he shot himself .
and i did find it in his paintings .
you better tell him the truth , you know ... when he wigs out like this , i can`t
there is no lily in the field .
lt`s a fucking myth like bigfoot or the loch ness monster .
the painting`s a fake , isn`t it ?
you set this whole thing up .
so what then ?
split the insurance money with alexsie ?
so what do you do now , huh ?
talk to me .
l`m the only friend you`ve got .
you watch too much tv .
there`s no evidence , no witnesses , and not a brain in this room .
i want my lawyer .
ldiots .
the boys will be back soon with my painting .
$20 million in bags downstairs .
and a dead thief .
how will your life change after that ?
little suza ?
my gun , my phone , and the painting .
the gun is gone .
the phone is in my pocket .
you could reach in there if you want it .
now , you are not a straight talking man , so why should i believe you ?
well , i didn`t lie to you .
i just didn`t tell you all the facts .
you know , i have a begrudging respect for you , tuliver .
you get a lead , gather a team ... and pull off one of the most daring robberies in history .
don`t ruin it by me killing you .
look , do you wanna be a hero or not ?
you`re negotiating ?
i will arrest you ...
i will clear my name and l`il make lieutenant .
then you`re gonna have to phone me in prison .
maybe you might like a relationship like that , i don`t .
look , i don`t give two shits about that painting .
there are people in there who are relying on me .
they`re gonna die if i don`t help them .
lt`s not your concern . lt`s a police matter .
what ?
romanian police , right ?
highly unlikely .
l`m getting out of this car .
not without a bullet in your body , you`re not .
sgt. anders , listen ...
i get my friends ... you get the painting , and you can keep all the money .
but if we wait for romanian police , it`s all gonna disappear .
with a whole lot of bullets .
lt. anders , huh ?
sounds pretty good .
you must be betting l`m some kind of idiot .
i hate betting .
never leave a man or woman in the field .
old habits .
shit !
what am i , chopped liver ?
tuliver , going in unarmed ?
not gonna do much good if they aim for the head .
well , i can duck .
firstly ...
i come with you .
all right .
second ?
secondly ... don`t ever make the mistake of thinking i won`t shoot you .
look , this ain`t target practice ... these guys are serious .
they will kill you .
just get us inside , rambo .
let me worry about the dying bit .
you should see this for yourself .
how many ?
about five plus .
all right .
how do we get in ?
quietly .
you wait here ... till i get inside , okay ?
don`t shoot until i do .
and ... try to aim and hit them , not me .
don`t get shot , jack .
i need you breathing .
see , you do care .
oh , shit !
fuck !
hey !
no !
i know where jack is .
fuck !
psych !
jack !
tuliver .
thank god .
they almost got me .
i had the drop on them .
i was gonna give it to them , spanky foo .
go !
fuck .
lt`s okay .
jack .
macking with the hos , jt ?
macking the 9 mm , dick .
oh , no .
go .
thanks .
thanks , j. t. thanks , mate .
let`s go .
you are persistent , jack .
you brought the cavalry .
well , you know ... you shoot her , we shoot you .
who wins , alexsie ?
i may have the gun pointed at her pretty head ... but i can`t be sure ...
i can stop from pulling the trigger .
i have a problem ... you might have noticed .
being a psychopath ?
you must be jack`s other girl .
nice job .
you have to save her , jack .
drop the fucking gun , now .
you drop the gun ... or i blow her fucking head off !
now !
i mean it , jack !
do it , jack !
now kick it over .
kick it !
now move back .
back , jack .
you see ... it is easy .
game over , jack .
l`m sorry .
you set me up ?
jack !
you set us all up .
all of them died because of you .
you killed bull .
fucking bitch .
well , that`s your problem , jack .
you always think for everyone else and not for yourself .
i don`t want ... a five way split and a beach hut .
i want a two way split .
that`s a cool $25 mil , with the painting .
i just needed someone to steal it for us .
wait , no .
but i heard you scream .
sometimes love is painful .
especially when you need to know where that case is .
costly case , that .
just point him in the right direction and he is twice the man you are , jack .
all drive and passion .
no fake orgasms here .
maybe l`il not be an art dealer anymore .
a man has to stick to what he is good at .
well ... where is my case ?
i won`t ask twice , jack .
lt`s in my car .
see ?
that wasn`t so hard now , was it ?
never let a woman in your business .
oh , shit !
mikhail .
oh , shit , indeed .
this is for bull .
now we`re even , jack .
anders , want a ride ?
show some appreciation ... for the man that saved you .
i have a ride .
save somebody`s life and that`s the gratitude .
no !
now we`re even .
obviously , l`m coming with you .
oh , no .
please , not this again .
shit !
excuse me , i have just been shot .
that`s got to hurt .
move !
shit !
you`re a lunatic .
probably .
you have been most uncooperative , mikhail .
told you , i know nothing .
police picked you up in a house with a dozen dead bodies .
with a bullet hole in your own leg .
yet you say you know nothing .
don`t bullshit me .
maybe a little time in jail might help him to ... refresh his memory .
she`s dead .
lf she`s dead ... why did we not find her body ?
these were professionals , captain .
professionals don`t leave dead cops for forensic evidence .
you`il never find anders .
unless you drain the entire black sea .
beautiful , worthless souvenir .
ready for a swim , shit bag ?
do i look like l`m ready for a swim ?
i mean , i like the lake ... but when are we gonna go to the beach ?
we can`t afford to be at the beach .
the beach , the beach .
there is nothing better than coming home ... after a long , hard day at work ... and sticking your feet in the hot sand ... and ...
and , and , and what ?
what if it`s not a fake ?
the painting ?
it is a fake .
i mean , we could sell it back to the insurance company .
no questions asked , $20 million .
it is ... a fake .
excuse me , do you speak german ?
english ?
english .
can i help you ?
yes , l`m looking for sgt. kelly anders .
i can help you .
my name is franz gustav .
dr. franz gustav ?
yes .
you authenticated the van gogh ?
yes .
when i heard that mark van der mer died ...
i panicked .
i thought i would be next .
l`ve never been involved in anything like this before .
so ... it is a fake ?
oh , no .
ln my opinion ... it`s the real thing .
read the newspapers today ?
what newspapers ?
tuliver , you lucky bastard !
jack .
what newspapers ?
got to read , baby .

got to read , you gotta read more .
