we need some more things .
right you are , miss .
how about this quality handcrafted tea set ?
uh , no .
or this lovely necklace and pendant ?
it' s love
or this beautiful little number , all the rage in the fashionable chicken coops of paris .
simply pop it on like so , and as the french hens say , " voila !
that' s french .
that' s two hats in one , miss .
for parties , for weddings .
oh , but madame , this makes you look like a vision , like a dream .
like a duck .
no , thank you .
we' re making this .
we need these things .
can you get them ?
oh , oh , oh , this is a big job , miss .
oh , bigger than the others .
no , no .
this is gonna cost .
same as always .
one bag of seed .
you call this pay ?
it' s chicken feed .
what else could we give you ?
eggs .
eggs ?
eggs .
we can' t give you our eggs .
they' re too valuable .
and so are we .
after you , fetcher .
after i what ?
move !
ooh !
hmm .
twenty two and nine .
fourteen shillings and three pence .
seven and sixpence times three .
two and nine .
four pence half penny .
d oh !
stupid , worthless creatures !
i' m sick and tired of making minuscule profits .
hmm .
hmm !
oh , yes .
those chickens are up to something .
quiet .
i' m onto something .
they' re organized .
i know it .
i said , quiet .
that ginger one .
i reckon she' s their leader .
mr. tweedy !
i may finally have found a way to make us some real money around here , and what are you on about ?
ridiculous notions of escaping chickens .
but but  it' s all in your head , mr. tweedy .
say it !
it' s all in me head .
it' s all in me head .
now , you keep telling yourself that , because i don' t want to hear another word about it .
is that clear ?
yes , love .
but you know that ginger one
they' re chickens , you dolt !
apart from you , they' re the most stupid creatures on this planet .
they don' t plot , they don' t scheme , and they are not organized !
order !
order !
quiet , everyone .
settle down .
i would like to call to order please , if you could just settle
let' s have some discipline in the ranks !
what , what !
thank you , fowler .
in my r. a. f. days , we were never allowed to waste time with unnecessary chitchat .
yes , thank you , fowler .
i
right !
carry on .
now , i know our last escape attempt was a bit of a fiasco , but mac and i have come up with a brand new plan .
show ' em , mac .
right .
we tried going under the wire and that didn' t work .
so , the plan is , we go over it .
this is us , right ?
we get in like this .
wind her up and ... let her go !
good grief !
the turnip' s bought it !
farmer' s coming !
operation cover up !
whee !
ouch !
hmm .
huh ?
mr. tweedy !
ooh .
ouch .
where are you ?
ooh .
it' s all in your head .
it' s all in your head .
it' s all in your head .
think , everyone , think .
what haven' t we tried yet ?
uh
we haven' t tried not trying to escape .
hmm .
that might work .
what about edwina ?
how many more empty nests will it take ?
perhaps it wouldn' t be empty if she' d spent more time layin ' and less time escapin ' .
so laying eggs all your life ... and then getting plucked , stuffed and roasted is good enough for you ?
it' s a livin ' .
you know what the problem is ?
the fences aren' t just round the farm .
they' re up here in your heads .
there' s a better place out there somewhere beyond that hill , and it has wide open spaces and lots of trees ... and grass .
can you imagine that ?
cool , green grass .
who feeds us ?
we feed ourselves .
well , where' s the farm ?
there is no farm .
then where does the farmer live ?
there is no farmer , babs .
is he on holiday ?
he isn' t anywhere .
don' tyou get it ?
there' s no morning head count , no farmers , no dogs and coops and keys ... and no fences .
in all my life i' ve never heard such a fantastic ...
load of tripe !
oh , face the facts , ducks .
the chances of us gettin ' out of here are a million to one .
then there' s still a chance .
oh , no , oh , no , oh , no .
what am i doing ?
who are you trying to fool ?
you can' t lead this bunch of
oh , heaven help us .
freedom !
huh ?
whoa !
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
you' ve been a wonderful audience .
ouch !
oh , yes .
that' s it .
get him inside quickly .
this is our way out of here .
we' il make posters ?
no .
what' s on the poster , babs .
what' s on the poster .
we' il fly out !
he must be very important to have his picture taken .
what do you suppose he does ?
isn' t it obvious ?
he' s a professional flying rooster .
he flies from farm to farm , giving demonstrations .
do you suppose ?
oh , absolutely .
notin the dark , no .
no , notin there .
no .
get out .
good .
gotta get
who are you ?
where am i ?
what' s goin ' on ?
ouch !
what happened to my wing ?
you took a rather nasty fall .
and sprained the anterior tendon connecting your radius to your humerus .
i gave it a wee bit of a tweak , jimmy , and wrapped her up .
was that english ?
she said you sprained your wing .
she fixed it .
i made the bandage .
i i carried you in .
whoa .
whoa .
whoa !
whoa .
let' s back up and start from the top .
where am i ?
you' re right .
how rude of us .
we' re just very excit
this is a chicken farm .
and we' re the chickens .
yeah , with you so far .
chicken farm , chickens
i don' t like the look of this one .
his eyes are too close together .
father , please .
and he' s a yank !
easy , pops .
cock fighting' s illegal where i come from .
and where is that exactly ?
just a little place i call the land of the free and the home of the brave .
scotland !
no !
america .
oh !
america .
poppycock .
pushy americans .
always showing up late for every war .
overpaid , oversexed and overhere !
what' s eatin ' grandpa ?
oh , don' t mind him , mister mister ?
the name' s rocky .
rocky the rhode island red .
rhodes for short .
rocky rhodes ?
catchy , ain' t it ?
um , mr. rhodes , is this you ?
uh , who wants to know ?
a group of rather desperate chickens .
you see , if it is you , then you just might be the answer to our prayers .
well , then , call me a miracle , doll face , ' cause that' s me .
and what brings you to england , mr. rhodes ?
why , all the beautiful english chicks , of course .
give over !
you see , i' m a traveler by nature .
i did that whole barnyard thing for a while , but i couldn' t really get into it .
hi .
how are you ?
nope .
the open road .
that' s more my style .
yep , just give me a pack on my back and point me where the wind blows .
in fact , you know what they call me back home ?
you' re gonna love this .
the lone free ranger .
ooh !
isn' t that great ?
i knew it was possible .
oh , it' s possible , all right .
i knew the answer would come .
amen !
we' re all going to fly over that fence , and mr. rhodes is going to show us how , right ?
that' s what ?
did you say " fly " ?
you can teach us .
no , i can' t .
listen .
shh .
you hear that ?
that' s the open road calling my name , and i was born to answer that call .
bye .
he must have very good hearing .
okay , okay , where' s the exit ?
ah , this way .
mr. rhodes , um , perhaps i didn' t explain our situation properly .
we lay eggs day in and day out , and when we can' t lay any more , they kill us .
it' s a cruel world , doll face .
you might as well get used to it .
which part of " they kill us " do you not understand ?
i got my own set of problems to worry about .
besides , this birdcage can' t be that hard to bust out of .
in fact , watch me .
it' s not so hard to get one chicken out of here or even two , but this is about all of us .
all of you ?
that' s what i' ve been trying to tell you .
wait a minute .
let me get this straight .
you want to get every chicken in this place out of here at the same time ?
of course .
you' re certifiable .
you can' t pull off a stunt like that .
that' s suicide .
where there' s a will , there' s a way .
couldn' t agree more .
i will be leaving that way .
but
mr. rhodes ?
i' m the type of guy
so that' s it .
you' re from the circus .
shh !
you' re on the run , aren' t you ?
you wanna keep it down ?
i' m trying to lay low here .
i should turn you in right now .
you wouldn' t .
would you ?
give me one reason why i shouldn' t .
because i' m ... cute ?
hey , hey , hey !
what kind of crazy chick are you ?
do you know what' il happen if he finds me ?
it' s a cruel world .
i just decided .
i don' t like you .
i just decided .
i don' t care .
now , show us how to fly .
with this wing ?
teach us then .
no !
he' s valuable , you say ?
sure .
get the torch .
now you listen here , sister .
i' m not going back to that life .
i' m a lone free ranger .
emphasis on free !
and that' s what we want .
freedom !
fancy that .
they' re coming this way .
oh , oh , no .
no .
oh , no .
they' re on to me .
teach us to fly and we' il hide you .
and if i don' t ?
was your father by any chance a vulture ?
do we have a deal ?
time to make good on that deal , doll
the name is ginger .
comfortable ?
not really .
maybe this will help .
nice hide out .
ouch .
i had more room in my egg .
we' ve held up our end of the deal .
tomorrow you hold up yours .
what deal ?
the flying !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
right , right , right .
don' t worry .
i' il teach you everything i know .
now , which bunk is mine ?
absolutely outrageous !
asking a senior officer to share his quarters ... and with a noncommissioned yank , no less .
why , back in my day , i' d never  hey !
you weren' t exactly my first choice either .
and scoot over .
your wing' s on my side of the bunk .
your side of the bunk ?
the whole bunk is my side of the bunk !
just what' s that smell ?
is that your breath ?
it' s absolutely outrageous .
so you wanna fly , huh ?
well , it ain' t gonna be easy , and it ain' t gonna happen overnight either .
you see , flying takes three things .
hard work , perseverance and
hard work .
you said hard work twice !
that' s because it takes twice as much work as perseverance .
codswallop !
now , the most important thing is we have to work as a team , which means ... you do everything i tell you .
right !
let' s rock and roll .
oh .
oh , oh .
oh .
oh , oh .
mrs. tweedy !
the chickens are
pecking ?
and left , two , three .
and right , two , three .
and ... stop right there .
oh , yeah , down .
down .
yeah , yeah , make little circles .
that' s it .
faster .
faster .
oh , yes .
perfect .
oh , that' s the spot .
i thought you were going to teach us how to fly .
that' s what i' m doing .
isn' t there usually some flapping involved ?
hey , do i tell you how to lay eggs ?
relax .
we' re making progress .
really ?
i can' t help feeling we' re going around in circles .
what the hey !
cut it out !
you' re making me dizzy .
i think they' re ready to fly now .
good , because they certainly can' t walk anymore .
up and at ' em , gals .
let' s flap .
watch , fetcher .
let' s see if old attila the hen has come to her senses .
it' s raining hen !
what' s this caper , love ?
we' re flying .
obviously .
flippin' hell .
lookat this , fetch .
they' re gonna kill themselves .
wanna watch ?
yeah , all right .
ooh !
ooh !
ahh !
ahh !
hey !
careful of those eggs !
sunny side up .
now they' re over easy !
definitely scrambled .
go !
go !
go !
go , go , go , go !
go !
poultry in motion !
birds of a feather flop together .
great work , ladies .
great work !
the pain you' re feeling is a good thing .
it' s good .
pain is your friend , okay ?
it' s a positive thing .
just keep the faith there , uh what was your name ?
agnes !
you' il get there .
ducky , i think you flew four feet today .
right , four feet !
from the roof to the ground .
it' s all part of the process , ladies .
nothing to worry about .
ya cheese eating little
whoa !
that doesn' t sound good .
ha , ha , ha .
okay , the ground' s shaking .
are we worried ?
are we worried ?
the circus .
quick .
hide me .
hide me .
come on .
one isn' t awarded a medal like this for flapping about like a lunatic , what .
now , see here !
this is an officer' s quarters .
quick .
in here .
get out of here immediately , sir !
give it a rest , pops .
out of here !
i shall have you on a charge within the week .
cheers , mate .
it' s all in your head .
it' s all in your head .
it' s all in your head .
ooh !
what what what' s all this then ?
this is our future , mr. tweedy .
no more wasting time with petty egg collection and minuscule profits .
no more eggs ?
but we' ve always been egg farmers .
me father and his father and all their fathers .
they was always
poor !
worthless .
nothings .
but all that' s about to change .
this will take tweedy' s farm out of the dark ages ... and into full scale automated production .
melisha tweedy will be poor no longer .
ooh !
i' il put it together then , shall i ?
this isn' t good , mac .
whatever' s in those boxes is for us , and i don' t think it' s softer hay .
aye , hen .
and i hate to be the voice of doom , but i' ve been calculating my figures , and i just don' t think we' re built for flyin ' .
but i saw him .
he flew in over that fence .
aye , aye , i believe you , but if we could just see it for ourselves , that may answer some questions .
you' re right .
i' m sorry .
we' ve been at this all week , and we' re getting nowhere .
if his wing were better , he could oh !
i' il have a word with him .
where is he ?
they didn' t give me this medal for being a yank nanny .
a simple " i don' t know " would suffice .
beware of that one , young ginger .
that yank is not to be trusted .
that yank is our ticket out of here .
and the pig says to the horse , " hey , fella , why the long face ?
oh , oh , look , look .
oh .
cocktail !
give over !
so , um , anyway
remember those flying tips tomorrow .
they' re very important .
keep thinking those flighty thoughts .
oh , yeah .
they' re swell chicks .
they really are .
look at what babs made me .
a beakwarmer .
isn' t that the cutest ?
and that bunty .
she really packs a punch .
is there a problem here ?
have we flown over that fence ?
not quite .
then there' s a problem .
good things come to those who wait , doll face .
ginger !
okay , how long did it take you ?
to do what ?
to learn how to fly .
apples and oranges , baby doll .
i' m gifted .
they' re not .
you can' t compare the two , okay ?
the point is , these things take time .
which we are rapidly running out of .
we haven' t even lifted off the ground .
why ?
thrust .
i went over my calculations , and i figured the key element we' re missing is thrust .
i i didn' t get a word of that .
thrust !
other birds like ducks and geese , when they take off , what do they have ?
thrust .
i swear she ain' t usin ' real words .
she said we need more thrust .
oh , thrust .
well , of course , we need thrust .
thrust and flying are like this .
that' s flying and that' s thrust .
would you excuse us ?
aye .
ah , the wing , the wing , the wing .
if we don' t see some results by tomorrow , the deal is off , and you' re on your own .
no more hiding .
the farmers will find you , and it' s back to the circus , flyboy .
you' re the first chick i ever met with the shell still on .
sleep tight , angel face .
the rock' s on the case .
ginger !
whew !
cock a doodle doo !
what , what .
oh , it was a beaut , guv' nor .
hmm ?
a finepiece of work , if i do say someself .
i say so meself too .
i wish i could have seen it .
we slipped into the farmer' s room , all quiet like .
like a fish .
yeah , and we
like a fish " ?
you stupid norbert .
anyway , guv , here it is .
el merchandiso .
that' s spanish .
what are these two crooks doing here ?
so , you know each other .
she don' t think we' re valuable .
guys , you are without a doubt the sneakiest , most light fingered thieving parasites i' ve ever met .
oh , don' t , don' t .
stop it .
i' ve gone bright red .
so , uh , how about them eggs ?
eggs ?
don' t tell me you promised them  yep !
promised them every egg i lay this month .
and when can we expect the first installment ?
i' m brewing one up as we speak , guys .
i' il keep you posted .
pleasure doing business with you , sir .
sucker .
what ?
you' ve lied to them .
i didn' t lie , doll face .
i just ... omitted certain truths .
i' il give them exactly what i promised .
which is nothing .
which is what i' il give them .
and what will you give us ?
thrust !
you okay , sweet heart ? good , good .
now this is just a little helper .
something to get you going .
it' s a thrust exercise .
the tension' s killing me .
it' s gonna kill her !
release !
whoa !
come on !
flap !
you can do it .
flap , flap , flap !
yes , yes , yes !
is that your first offense ?
oops .
roll call !
i haven' t laid any eggs .
hide me .
three days and not one .
oh , no !
why didn' t you tell us , babs ?
hide me !
we' ve been so busy with the flying
they' re coming !
hide me !
hide yourself !
oh !
double their food rations , mr. tweedy .
i want them all as fat as this one .
oh !
all of me life flashed before me eyes !
it was really borin ' .
chicken feed .
my favorite !
wait .
wait .
ooh !
no .
wait !
babs , please !
bunty !
stop it !
wait !
stop !
stop it !
something is wrong here .
can' t you see that ?
strange boxes arrive in the barn .
babs stops laying , but they don' t take her to the chop , and now they' re giving us extra food .
don' t you see what' s happening ?
they' re fattening us up .
they' re going to kill us all .
whoa , whoa !
heavy alert .
she didn' t mean that , gals .
do you mind ?
keep eating .
save some for me .
what are you doing ?
how dare you !
let go of me !
listen .
i' ve met some hard boiled eggs in my day , but i' d say you' re about 20 minutes .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it means you got to lighten up .
over in america , we have this rule .
if you want to motivate someone , don' t mention death .
funny .
always tell the truth .
that' s been working like a real charm , hasn' t it ?
here' s some free advice .
you want them to perform ?
tell them what they wanna hear .
you mean lie .
here we go again .
you know what your problem is ?
you' re ... difficult .
why ?
because i' m honest ?
i care about what happens to them , something i wouldn' t expect a lone free ranger to know anything about .
if this is the way you show it , i hope you never care about me .
i can assure you , i never will .
good !
fine !
what' s all this ?
well , here she is .
ask and you shall receive .
that' s biblical .
that' s real craftsmanship is what it is .
solidas a rock .
ooh !
it' s supposed to do that .
it' s perfect , guys .
and how' s that egg coming ?
this is a doubleyolker .
i don' t see what this has to do with

yes , but  i don' t want to be a pie .
i don' t like gravy .
ladies , please .
let' s not lose our heads .
lose our heads ?
what i meant to say was , rocky sabotaged the machine and bought us more time .
ooh !
ooh !
and better still , he' s going to fly for us tomorrow .
and once we' ve seen how' s it done , we' il get it .
so don' t worry , because tomorrow everything' s going to go much , much smoother .
all right , pops , what did i do now ?
a very brave and honorable deed , sir .
in the light of your action this evening , i
i dutifully admit that i have misjudged your character .
so i present you with this medal for bravery .
and ...
i salute you .
in honor of the occasion ,
i surrender the bunk entirely .
i shall sleep under the stars .
oh , uh , i await tomorrow' s flying demonstration ... with great anticipation .
you and me both , pops .
oh !
i' m sorry .
were you
is this your i' il get down .
no , no , it' s just
since you' re here  no , i' m glad you' re here , because
i' m sorry .
you go first .
you go ahead .
i' il
um , i just wanted to say ...
i may have been a bit harsh at first .
well , what i really mean is , thank you ... for saving my life .
for saving our lives .
you know ,
i come up here every night ... and look out to that hill and just imagine what it must be like on the other side .
it' s funny , i' ve
i' ve never actually felt grass beneath my feet .
i' m sorry .
here i am rambling on about hills and grass , and you had something to say .
uh , y y yeah .
um , it' s just that , y you know ,
life as i' ve experienced it , you know , out there ,
lone free rangin ' and stuff , it' s , uh , it' s full of disappointments and , uh
what , you mean grass isn' t all it' s cracked up to be ?
grass !
exactly .
grass .
it' s always greener on the other side .
and then you get there and it' s brown and prickly .
you see what i' m tryin ' to say ?
what i' m trying to say is , you' re welcome .
you know , that hill is looking closer tonight than it ever has before .
oh !
well , good night ...
rocky .
good night ...
ginger .
company , attention !
well , today' s the day , girls .

better start warming up .
i' il go and get him .
rocky .
knock knock .
everyone' s waiting , so i told them to
r rocky ?
oh , a cannon .
aye , that would give you thrust .
i knew he was fake all along .
in fact , i' m not even certain he was american .
so , what' s the next plan , hen ?
let' s face it .
the only way out of here is wrapped in pastry .
perhaps he just went on holiday .
perhaps he just went to get away from your infernal knitting !
ohh !
ohh !
you were the one that was always hitting him .
see how you like it .
don' t push me , four eyes !
quiet there !
quiet , i say !
dissension in the ranks .
precisely what jerry would have wanted .
the old divide and conquer .
a proper squadron work together , like we did in my r. a. f. days .
jocko at the stick , flappy at the map ... and old whizzbang at the tail end charlie .
wingco would give the call , hop in the old crate , chocks away !
wizard show it was .
that' s how you get medals .
will you shut up about your stupid blooming medals !
ooh !
ohh !
how dare you !
madam , forgive me .

in fact , there' s a bit of a story to that as well .
we were out on a " recce , " you see .
ops had given the go ahead , but the weather duffed up .

back in your day the royal air force 6 4 4 squadron , poultry division .
we were the mascots .
you mean you never actually flew the plane ?
good heavens , no .

the royal air force doesn' t let chickens behind the controls of a complex aircraft .
we' re all gonna die !
fowler , you have to fly it .

whee !
let ' er go !
so ... is it as good as you imagined ?
no .
it' s better .
come on .
i' il show you how to play cricket .
' ey , ' ey , here' s a thought .
why don' t we get an egg and start our own chicken farm ?
that way we' il have all the eggs we could eat .
right .
we' il need a chicken then .
no .
no , we' il need an egg .
you have the egg first .
that' s where you get the chicken from .
no , that' s cobblers .
if you don' t have a chicken , where you gonna get an egg ?
from the chicken that comes from the egg .
yeah , but you have to have an egg to have a chicken .
yeah , but you gotta get the chicken first to get the egg , and then the egg you get the chicken out .
hang on .
let' s go over this again .
yeow !
all right .
yeah .
when i get the blues gon ' get me a rockin ' chair
when i get the blues gon ' get me a rockin ' chair
when the blues over take me
gonna rock on away from here ohh
here comes my baby flashin ' a new gold tooth
here comes my baby flashin ' a new gold tooth
yeah , she' s so small
she can rumba in a pay phone booth
that' s the truth .
ha ha !
flip , flop , fly
i don' t care if i die
flip , flop , fly
i don' t care if i die
don' t ever leave me don' t ever say good bye
yeow !
now , give me one more kiss
and hold it along , long time
give me one more kiss
and hold it along , long time
love me , baby , till the feelin ' hits my head like wine
so fine so glad you' re mine
flip , flop , fly
i don' t care if i die
flip , flop , fly
i don' t care if i die
don' t ever leave me don' t ever say good bye
don' t ever leave me don' t ever say good bye
bye bye , bye bye ohh
don' t ever leave me don' t ever say good bye
yeah !
bye bye !
the egg , obviously .
rollin ' along , happy as larry .
then , crack !
hatches into the first chicken .
yeah , but where' d the egg come from , then ?
what do you mean , where ' dit come from ?
egg comes rollin ' along , happy as larry .
it' s wonderin ' , where ' dit come from ?
without a chicken , you get no egg to come rollin ' along .
well , conversely , without an egg to hatch into the chicken , there will be no chicken to lay the other egg that hatches into the chicken ... that lays the egg i mentioned in the first place .
so we got two eggs now ?
no , we' re still talking about the very first egg .
but what happened about the very first chicken ?
he' s in the very first egg !
aren' t you listenin ' ?
uh , guys .
guys ?
try in' to enjoy paradise over here .
oh , sorry , guv .
beg your pardon .
won' t happen again .
thanks .
gitface .
pillock .

but he does get all the birds .
he gets everything .

you said it , mate .
