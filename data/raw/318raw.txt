every day when one' s body and mind are at peace ,
one should meditate upon being ripped apart
by arrows , rifles , spears and swords ,
being carried away by surging waves ,
being thrown into the midst of a great fire ,
being struck by lightning ,
being shaken to death by a great earthquake ,
falling from thousand foot cliffs , dying of disease
or committing seppuku at the death of one' s master .
i' il get you the rest tomorrow .
no problem .
' listen , frank ...
' don' t fuck around with the boss' s daughter . '
' don' t break my balls , uncle joe . '
' asshole , listen to me .
' she' s been in and out of psychiatric hospitals .
' she' s a wacko . ' ' yeah , yeah ... '
' vargo has put the family money in her trust fund . '
' i already know . ' ' you' il get clipped . '
are you finished yet , uncle joe ?
' you' il get whacked ! '
i' m not fu ...
i' m not fucking dead yet , so let' s get off the goddamn phone .
' are you listening ?
that girl' s a fucking wacko . '
' yeah , i know . ' ' vargo' s crazy about her .
' you know what " crazy " means ? '
' yeah , i know , uncle joe . '

i' m using my special guy .
what about the girl ?
morini put her on the bus ... to the seashore .
good .
i don' t feel good about it .
handsome frank' s a made guy and all .
a good soldier .
i feel a little bad .
forget about it .
handsome frank fucked up .
pay your respects at the funeral .
yeah ...
' home in ! '
' one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . '
have some more wine , louise .
i don' t want any more wine .
what the fuck ?
what do you want ?
my rolex ?
whatever ...
did my father send you here to do this ?
it' s a good book .
ancient japan was a pretty strange place .
you can have it .
i' m finished with it .
i' ve got a bad feeling , vin .
first valerio calls me in for a sit down with vargo himself .
and now the bird .
here , birdy birdy .
come here , you little fucker .
goddammit , this is ridiculous .
i can' t write this small .
can' t we swag a fax machine and get it to this guy ?
it ain' t the middle ages .
come here , birdy .
i got him , louie !
louie , i got him .
i got the sucker .
little fucker , here we go .
easy now , mr chicken , easy .
mother of jesus , vin , hold it still !
i don' t want to hurt him .
ready ?
yeah , ok .
go home , little birdy , go home .
' shit !
shit ! '
' what' s going on ?
what' s the problem here ? '
you little brat !
you want us to come up there ?
fuck you !
then you gonna get it !
you little prick !
eat me !
cocksucker .
hey , louie .
what the fuck are you guys doing ?
his mother went to work and locked him in .
he' s mad as hell .
vargo' s waiting for us .
you' ve got bigger problems than this .
johnny , you said the girl was on the fucking bus last night .
what happened ?
she was .
i don' t know what happened .
let' s go .
come on , vin , let' s go .
ghost dog !
knowledge to knowledge , baby .
shit !
how you doin ' ?
how are you ?
they' re inside , waiting for you .
condolences on handsome frank .
thank you .
my thoughts are with you , joe .
they' re waiting for you .
i' m sorry about frank .
thank you .
sorry about your nephew , kid .
they whacked him .
what are you gonna do ?
that' s the way it goes .
hey .
go in , they' re waiting .
thanks .
louie , how' s it going ?
i' m sorry we' re late , mr vargo .
mr bonacelli was ... delayed on his way over .
sit down .
johnny , step outside , have a smoke .
sure , sonny .
mr vargo .
we got a big problem here .
seems like you' re responsible .
your mystery man fucked up .
morini told me he put the girl ... ..
mr vargo' s daughter , on the bus .
he did ... but she got off and went to handsome frank' s house .
you wanted handsome frank whacked ...
so he got whacked .
from outside .
i set it all up .
no traces , no nothing .
morini said that she was on the bus .
jesus , it' s lucky he didn' t do her , too .
right ?
if he had , you would be fucking dead .
this is not a good situation .
where is she ?
is she ok ?
don' t worry about mr vargo' s daughter .
we need to eliminate the scumbag who whacked frank .
frank was one of us .
his killer needs to be ... neutralised .
erased from the planet .
for the past four years , he' s done maybe 12 perfect contracts .
perfect .
like a ghost .
he' s valuable .
totally untraceable .
if he' d realised anyone would be there , he' d have backed off .
he sure didn' t know that she was gonna ... be there .
louie , unless you wanna be buried next to frank , tell us everything about this mysterious , ghostlike , untraceable fuckin ' button man .
ok , ok .
er , let' s see ...
i don' t pay him by the job .
he' il only work if i pay once a year on the first day of autumn .
first day of autumn , i settle up for that past year , see ?
the first day of autumn ...
ok , ok .
let' s skip that part .
where does he live ?
fucked if i know .
that' s the next strange thing .
i can' t call him .
he contacts me only through a bird .
since i first started contracting stuff out to him , the bird comes every single day .
hold it , hold it , hold it .
did you say he contacts you through a fucking bird ?
did i just hear that ?
what particular species ... of bird ?
it' s a pigeon .
it must be a carrier pigeon or whatever .
passenger pigeon !
they' ve been extinct since 1914 !
am i fucking dreaming here or what ?
ok , louie , forget about the bird .
let me ask you this .
tell me , what does this mysterious guy look like ?
he' s a big guy .
a big black guy .
he' s what ?
he said the guy' s a nigger !
maybe eight years ago , i saw a guy , this guy .
' he was a kid in a bad situation . '
stupid ass motherfucker !
get his ass up here !
you motherfucker !
what' s the problem here ?
' so i ... straightened things out . '
anyway , about four years ago , this big guy comes to my door .
this black guy , got a fucking pigeon on his shoulder .
fuck knows how he found me , but he said he owed me .
i only saw him once after that and we made this arrangement .
that' s very touching , louie .
let me just backtrack for a second .
the bird comes to your house every day .
did he come today ?
yes , the bird was there this morning .
did he have a message ?
the usual " mission accomplished " message .
uh huh .
and did you send a message back ?
no .
you' d called me in , so i figured it was best to leave it alone .
did you follow this bird ?
put a bug on it ?
anything like that ?
no , i never had a reason to do anything like that .
i realise the arrangement i made with this guy is pretty weird , but he' s always shown me complete respect .
a whole new century is coming , and mr vargo wants every member of this family to make it a priority to erase this weirdo .
this guy is a professional .
going after him could be dangerous .
handsome frank was one of us , so we' re gonna peel this nigger' s cap back .
better him than you , right ?
now , what the fuck is his name ?
ghost dog .
what ?
ghost dog .
ghost dog ?
he said ghost dog !
he calls himself ghost dog .
a lot of these black guys , gangster type guys , they all got names like that .
is that true ?
he means like the rappers .
the rappers got names like that snoop doggy dogg ,
ice cube , q tip , method man .
my favourite was always flavor flav from public enemy .
he got the funky fresh fly flava .
live lyrics from the bank of reality .
i kick da flyest dope manoeuvre technicality , to a dope track .
i love that guy .
i know nothing about that , but it makes me think about indians .
they' ve got names like red cloud , crazy horse ,
running bear , black elk ...
that kind of shit .
indians , niggers ... same thing !
johnny !
sonny ?
mr vargo ?
go outside .
get sammy the snake , joe rags , big angie .
get ' em in here .
right away .
yes !
hey !
peace , dog !
is that your dog ?
no .
i thought maybe it was your dog .
what ?
what ?
he' s really staring at you .
maybe he wants my ice cream .
i don' t think so .
if he' s bothering you , why not tell him to go away ?
go on .
i' ve seen you before ...
' cause you always carry that briefcase .
you live on the roof of the building down from me , where the birds fly out from .
mom says you talk to nobody and you got no friends .
i don' t know your mom .
is it true ?
what ?
you never talk to nobody and you got no friends .
no , i' m talking to you , right ?
yeah .
right .
you got your lunch in that box ?
what you got in the briefcase ?
i asked you first .
no .

i got my books .

i didn' t read all of it , but i plan to .
you got time .
night nurse " ? !
you read that ?
no , i just like the cover .
right ...
frankenstein " .
that' s a good book .
yeah , better than the movie .
you thought so , too ?
yeah .
can i see it ?
yeah .
he sprung from the cabin window
upon the ice raft , which lay close to the vessel .
he was soon borne away by the waves ,
and lost in darkness ... and distance .
hey , that' s the end !
don' t give away the ending .
the monster ...
frankenstein .
rashomon " .
what' s this about ?
pearline ?
you can borrow that .
you just gotta promise that when you read it , you come tell me what you think .
ok , i will .
is it true you got no friends , then ?
no .
my best friend' s right over there .
you wanna meet my best friend ?
i don' t see anybody .
he' s there in that ice cream truck .
what do you think , i' m a chump ?
i' m not going there .
i hardly know you .
whatever .
well , all right .
pearline , where are you going ?
i' m going to get ice cream .
i' m coming right back .
this is my best friend , raymond .
raymond , this is ...
pearline , right ?
yeah .
my best friend .
well , ok .
thanks .
chocolate' s my favourite .
yeah .

what language is he talking ?
french .
he only speaks french .
do you understand french ?
no .
i never understand a word he says .
and that' s your best friend ?
yeah .
bears ?
yes !
bravo !
what' s he talking about ?
bears , i guess .
i gotta go .
i got some business to take care of .
for the ice cream .
that book , read it and tell me what you think , ok ?
ok .
ok .
take it easy , raymond .
that fucking thing loaded ?
yeah , ok .
come on , let' s do it .
ready ?
that could be him right there .
should i shoot him ?
no , that ain' t him .
vargo said it was a black guy .
so , what' s he ?
what are you , puerto rican ?
i think he' s an indian .
what the hell are you ?
cayuga .
cayuga ?
what the fuck is cayuga ?
puerto rican , indian , nigger ... same thing .
we should waste him to be sure .
it ain' t authorised , so let' s go .
i wanna get the right guy .
stupid fucking white man .
what ?
i said stupid fucking white man .
you red nigger looking sitting bullshit motherfucker !
sam , you' re losing control .
let' s get out of here .
cayuga , my ass !
you better learn to keep your fucking mouth shut , or i' il blow your fucking brains out myself .
you dumb fuck !
hey , what the heck is going on , fellas ?
what ?
what ?
ah , shit !
i don' t think that' s him .
how the hell do you know ?
it doesn' t feel right .
now he' s got his own wings , he can fly with his pigeons .
vargo said , if he even looks like him , shoot him , right ?
i know .
let' s go .
i gotta take care of something for sonny .
fuck .
i knew that was gonna be you .
you gonna kill me ?
you might as well kill me .
i' m your retainer .
i follow a code .
i' ve always given you my respect .
that' s why you' ve got that big fucking gun to my head ?
forgive me .
i don' t mean you no disrespect .
how the fuck did you find me ?
called me for a meeting .
yeah .
everything seems to be changing all around us .
you can say that again .
when you did that guy the other night , was a girl there ?
i wasn' t instructed to eliminate her .
i know , it' s just that ... things have gotten all complicated now .
they' re gonna whack you , ghost dog .
if they don' t find you , they' re gonna whack me instead .
probably whack me anyways .
ray vargo ?
the whole family' s looking for you .
the underboss , valerio , too ?
of course .
he pulls all the ...
hey ...
how the fuck do you know so much about our organisation ?
who was the girl ?
she' s ...
forget about her , i can' t talk about that .
i' m warning you that they' re gonna kill you .
maybe me , too .
better me than you , louie .
well ...
right now , i' d have to agree with that .
hey , louie !
sorry i' m late ... and i' m real sorry about this .
jesus christ !
you just shot morini .
valerio' s fucking brother in law !
he was gonna shoot you .
what ?
see if he' s dead .
i don' t think he' s getting any older .
roll him over .
now you really better shoot me .
there' s no way i' m gonna explain this .
fuckin ' morini !
ok , shoot me .
go ahead , kill me now .
i' m your retainer .
it' s against the code of the samurai .
if you' re my retainer , whatever that is , then do what i tell you !
oww !
what did you that for ?
you told me to .
i don' t mean you no disrespect .
now you' ve got an excuse .
tell them i attacked you both .
you better watch your back , ghost dog !
like you said , everything seems to be changing around us .
nothing makes sense any more .
i' m gonna take your knight .
talking about ice cream ?

how the hell is he gonna get it down from here ?
ah ...
i gotta go .
i got business to take care of .
the sun' s coming down .
yeah .
there is something you could do for me .
yeah .
' and now , my newest invention . '
' i can turn diamonds ... into jelly beans !
' but do you think i' m happy ?
' no !
i' m frustrated , frustrated , frustrated , frustrated !
' you ask why ?
felix the cat and his bag of tricks .
' it' s magic ! '
' i' il make a canoe . '
' magic and more magic ! '
i thought we discussed this yesterday .

send him home , vinny .
it says , " if a samurai' s head were to be suddenly cut off ,
he should still be able to perform one more action ...
with certainty .
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
it' s poetry .
the poetry of war .
excuse me , excuse me !
step into the alley , please !
ok !
plan b.
hello , i' m bob solo .
i' m with west side realty .
i have an appointment with mr vargo .

it' s very important .
i may have a buyer for the estate .

what are you , a game warden ?
some kinda fed ?
no , no .
i' m just asking , you know , just asking .
well , i' il tell ya .
there aren' t too many of these big black fuckers left here .
so when you get a clear shot at it , you sure as hell take it .
that' s why you shoot ' em ... .. ' cause there' re not that many left ?
i don' t think i understand your question .
you know , there ain' t that many coloured people here , neither .
you oughta get back in your car and go about your own business .
yeah ... maybe you' re right .
jesus christ , you fucking hit my knee !
you know , in ancient cultures ... bears were considered equal with men .
this ain' t no ancient culture here , mister .
sometimes it is .
' aaaahh ... '
you know , louie ...
there' s one good thing about this ghost dog guy .
what' s that , vin ?
he' s sending us out in the old way .
like real fucking gangsters .
hang on , vin .
you' re gonna make it .
just hang in there .
oh , christ !
fucking five o .
remain inside the vehicle .
when you' re in the city , you never see a cop , but here , they' re like the fucking gestapo !
like we' re in some fucking foreign country !
my friend has to get to a hospital .
what happened to your arm ?
i' m fine , it' s my friend here .
license and registration , please .
we don' t have time !
don' t push me , mister !
remain inside the vehicle .
oh , yeah ...
this is terrific .
what' s the situation here , sir ?
let' s get the fuck out of here , louie !
jesus , vin !
you just iced a woman , you know that ?
you know what you are , louie ?
you' re a fucking male chauvinist pig .
what do you mean , i' m a male chauvinist pig ?
you just shot a broad !
a cop !
i just shot a cop .
they wanna be equal ...
i made her equal .
vin ?
hey , vin !

oh , no .
no ...
hey , raymond .
i ain' t seen you in a while , man .
that little girl , pearline ?
she probably wanted to give me that book back .
i wonder what she thought about it .
hey , man ...
it' s a little big , but one of those haitian tailors can cut up , fit it for you .
yeah , that' s for you .
hi , guys !
my fucking jaguar !
shit !

oh , man .

ghost dog .

raymond !
raymond , man .
hey .
you look worried .
don' t worry , man .
it' s ok .
it' s all right .
i need to get inside the truck , all right ?
let me get in the truck .
turn around , man .
turn around , turn around .
no , no ...
no , thanks .
i' m not hungry .
here , i wanna give you this .
i don' t want you to worry , raymond .
don' t you worry about nothing .
everything happens for a reason .
you know that guy who was here , with his arm in a sling ?
yeah ...
i know that guy .
he' s name' s louie .
i' m his retainer .
see , once , a long time ago , he helped me out .
you motherfucker !
what' s going on ?
what' s the problem here ?
' and i owed him for that .
' see , a samurai must always stay loyal to his boss .
' no matter what happens . '
anyway , me and him , we' re from different ancient tribes .
and now , we' re both almost extinct .
sometimes ... you gotta stick with the ancient ways .
the old school ways .
i know you understand me .
i know you understand me .
hello ?
anyone home in there ?
no , but thank you .
i' m not really hungry .
ghost dog , i brought your book back .
i finished it a few days ago , but i didn' t see you .
what did you think ?
i liked all six different stories .
ancient japan was a pretty weird place .
but i especially liked the first story .
it' s one story , but each person sees a totally different story .
that was really good .
" yabu no naka " .
that' s my favourite , too .
well , thank you for returning it , and thank you for your comments .
will you do me a favour ?
what ?
take this book ... and you read it some time .
you don' t gotta read it right away .
ok .
is it good ?
yeah , well ...
i liked it a lot .
it' s not exactly a story , it' s kind of a ...
ghost dog !
you should go home now .
what is this , louie ?
high noon " ?
this is the final shoot out scene ?
i guess it is .
yeah ...
well , it' s very dramatic .
it' s very dramatic ... and i understand .
you have to avenge the death of your bosses , right ?
well , ok , then .
stay back !
raymond !
stay back .
now you' re gonna be the boss of your own clan , right , louie ?
' cause ... there ain' t nobody else left ...
ain' t that right , louie ?
no , not exactly , ghost dog .
stay there !
it' s like you said , better you than me , right ?
nothing makes any sense any more .
it' s ok , louie .
i' ve seen everything i need to see .
do me one favour , though .
one favour .
what do you want me to do ?
you take this book ... and read it some time .
then , later on ... you can tell me what you think .
yeah ... sure .
let' s go !
let' s get out of here !
this is my book .
no , miss vargo , i got it from the guy , from ghost dog !
can we get out of here ?
it takes place in ancient japan .
you should read it .
we can go now .
pearline , you' re in the way , honey .
why don' t you go in the other room to read your book , darling ?
