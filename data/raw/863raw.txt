i was living in this duplex .
for the first time , i was alone .
no dorm , no roommates , my own place .
i was so happy .
i had my own parking space .
where i come from , they don' t keep them in cages .
they keep them in bins , you know , so you can reach in and touch them .
hello .
need some help ?
no , i ...
well , yeah , thanks .
i' m from spain .
really ?
which part ?
galicia .
i' m taking engineering at u of w.
i like seattle .
u dub .
that' s what people call it here .
finally , a local tells me some secrets .
you don' t have to stay .
this is gonna take some time .
where else do i have to go ?
in one week , i have to go back to spain .
my visa runs out .
u dub .
this is linda powell from the seattle environmental council .
okay , great .
thank you .
bye bye .
yes , that' s right , there' s another spill in bellingham .
we gotta get somebody out there ...
ruth , how long have i been saying there are no guys ?
forever .
i met one .
i met one when i was least expecting it .
you held out on me .
he' s an engineering student from spain .
his visa runs out in two days .
he' s ...
he' s like a comet .
what do i do ?
i wish you could stay .
if i overstay my visa , i can' t come back for five years .
were you ever gonna come back ?
well , now i have a reason .
i want you to have this .
i wish i was better able to tell you what i am thinking .
but this is a symbol of our future .
i want to return in two months and see you again .
i don' t really have much to give you , but ...
it' s important to me .
use this when you get back .
you' il always have a parking space .
hello .
don' t wake up .
i' m getting on the plane .
i wanted to say bye .
i' il see you soon .
goodbye , linda .
goodbye , honey .
i miss you already .
did you perform any other acts with him before he left ?
it' s amazing .
we can' t hide things in language .
we speak in basics .
basics " ?
if i married him , he could live here .
i' d always have someone to go out with .
you' re talking about marrying this guy ?
i' m tired of all the games .
if you were married , would we still go out dancing ?
we will always go out dancing .
what ? !
we will always go out dancing !
this is the genie .
can' t go wrong with this garage door opener .
here' s the liftrex and the liftrex super .
might be more than you need .
and , of course , the linear pocket pager , beeper ... ... garage door opener combo .
give me the best one you have .
i' il never lose it again .
i recently broke up with jennifer , my last girlfriend .
i did it in a crowded restaurant .
how can you pass me up ?
i told her we weren' t right , all the stuff we both knew .
i realized i was wrong , tried to get back with her .
she won' t see me .
now she' s with tony .
tony knows my friend bailey , who' s friends with tony' s other girl , rita .
rita , who i broke up with to go out with jennifer .
so do i tell jennifer i know tony' s going out with rita ... ... or do i tell rita i know about tony and jennifer ?
tony will tell jennifer i was dating rita when i was with her .
how does stuff get so complicated ?
i don' t know .
sometimes i wish it was as simple as this postcard somebody sent me once .
isn' t that great ?
i don' t know .
i think ...
cliff !
i' m talking here , man .
i' m back to the beginning .
my dad left home when i was 8 .
have fun .
stay single .
i was 8 .
my mom' s a teacher .
she took me to a doctor to learn about sex .
he was from boston .
the father and the mother have finally learned to come together .
the father inserts his penis ...
you do know what the penis is , don' t you , steve ?
the father inserts the penis into the mother' s vagina .
this is called intercourse , and what comes out is called sperm .
and then , the man keeps moving until something squirts out of his penis .
what ?
yeah , what comes out ?
spam !
oh , man !
so maybe it was never simple .
i' il tell you this ... ... for the next three years , i' m going to concentrate on work .
work is the only thing i have complete control over .
work .
i gotta go .
i' m 23 .
remember how old 23 seemed when you were little ?
i thought people would be traveling in air locks and i' d have five kids .
here i am , 23 .
things are ...
they' re basically the same .
i think time' s running out to do something bizarre .
somewhere around 25 , bizarre becomes immature .
i get inspiration from my boyfriend .
he' s a musician .
his band put out an independent album last month .
he' s a good artist too .
he' s like a renaissance man .
i' m so glad he moved into my building .
janet .
what' s the ordeal ?
your machine wasn' t on , and i was supposed to see you saturday but ...
so i just thought i' d come by and say , hi .
hi .
hey .
so how about this weekend ?
this weekend we' re really busy .
we got that show , right ?
yeah , that show .
we got these guys coming from l. a. great .
it' s gonna be rocking .
bye , cliff .
so come over after .
deal .
look , janet , you know i see other people still , right ?
you do know that , don' t you ?
you don' t fool me .
janet , i could not be fooling you less .
cliff , you gotta move your truck , man .
i know what you' re thinking .
we connected .
and when you make the connection , chemistry takes care of itself .
so sit back and enjoy it because you know when it' s real .
this is real .
we just don' t even have to discuss it .
janet , you' re spazzing off on me .
hey , cliff , while we' re young .
so i' il see you saturday , and then i' il help you with your speakers .
what can i say , man ?
she' s crazy about me .
check it out , my new gortec watch .
i can store 20 numbers .
tonight , i' il fill it .
all or nothing .
tonight , i' il be the super me .
what if the super you meets the super her , and the super her rejects you ?
then it' s no problem .
why ?
because it was never you .
it was just an act .
i live my life like a french movie .
what ?
webster and 24th , it should be here .
let' s ask this clown where the club is .
hey , man ... ... where' s de soto ?
i get it , you' re a mime .
mime the address .
well , give me a ride , and i' il show you .
where' s de soto ?
our car broke down .
i' il tell you about love .
love disappears , baby .
when i' ve been broke , babe has been off like a prom dress .
maybe it' s the girls you choose .
maybe i' ve been hurt , or i' ve been dogged !
know where this place is ?
do i look like a thomas guide ?
you really shouldn' t speak .
yes .
where do you work ?
i' m a matre d ' .
department of transportation .
solving the gridlock .
i build airplanes .
hey .
hello .
my friend and i have this argument , and here it is .
he says when you' re at a place like this ... ... you can' t just be yourself , you need an act .
i could just leave you alone .
i could just be myself .
i chose c.
what do you think ?
not having an act is your act .
thank you .
cliff , any comments on the seattle sound and citizen dick' s place in it ?
i don' t like to reduce us just to being part of seattle .
i think of us expanding more .
we' re huge in europe right now .
we' ve got records ...
a big record just broke in belgium .
a song like " touch me , i' m dick " is about what ?
i think " touch me , i' m dick , " in essence , speaks for itself .
i think , you know , that' s basically what the song is about .
it' s about , you know ...
a lot of people might think it' s actually about ... ... my name is dick , and you can touch me ... ... but i think , you know , it can be seen either way .
hey , excuse me !
hello .
hi .
want to meet up later ?
where you going ?
anywhere you' re going .
anywhere you' re going .
we' re going home .
going home .
do you have a ... ?
see you .
anywhere you' re going .
always get their numbers .
i got 20 numbers .
twenty numbers .
bailey , you got 20 numbers of 20 girls that you will never call ... ... never go out with , never see in the daylight .
twenty numbers that exist only to make you feel like you can get 20 numbers .
watch the volume .
sorry .
tinnitus .
club disease .
you kids are all going to be deaf .
bailey .
this is my night .
what ?
look .
linda , don' t look over .
cliff , i need another double latte , no cream , skim milk , decaf .
i' m going to use that video date you got me last christmas .
it was a joke .
i know .
i know .
you think it' s something desperate people do .
you are wrong !
expect the best is the best video dating in the country .
hi !
debbie hunt .
call me before i go to cabo .
your medication , miss hunt .
thank you .
you make the greatest coffee .

you ...
my roommate has no domestic ...
guys just don' t know ...
did you get the tunnel stuff ?
i' il call you back .
the l 90 construction is behind .
no green time from the exits .
the times asked why there' s gridlock on the l 5 .
it' s god' s way of saying , " listen to the radio .
did you read my proposal ?
what' d you think ?
i liked it .
you have to move it past stu .
stu ?
after lunch .
after lunch , okay .
after lunch , stu .
ted , what' s up ?
making music with my fingers .
and what a beautiful sound it is .
linda powell , steve dunne .
hey .
yeah , i met you 61 hours ago .
yeah , that was me .
listen , you want to get some dinner or ... ?
busy .
how about some lunch ?
have a lunch .
coffee ?
water ?
how about some water ?
i' il meet you where you' re having lunch , and we' il have some water .
i think that this whole decade will be about cleaning up .
our project spent last year studying the alaskan exxon spill .
and now ...
and now with all the exxon kickbacks , it' s ...
god , yes .
the worst .
yes .
i' m trying to put together a group to go study the whole coast .
i' m having a little trouble trying to get a boat .
i think it will work out .
what ?
there' s just no privacy anymore .
i thought he was literally gonna swallow her .
me too .
my god .
do you know what time it is ?
yeah , 3 : 30 .
oh , i' m so late .
i' m glad your lunch date didn' t show .
me too .
did you really have a lunch date ?
no .
maybe ...
i' m getting over somebody .
nothing big .
i think it' s a bad time to get ...
okay .
okay .
here' s my car .
let me give you a ride back to work .
okay .
thanks .
thanks .
i really like your take on the supertrain .
it' s ambitious .
if it were up to me ...
she opened my car door button .
unmistakable sign .
i like this girl .
gotta handle this one really well .
the thing i like about you the best is that you listen to me .
you' re a realist slash dreamer .
thanks .
i get so pissed off when i think about it .
that some jerk could trash the mona lisa or an ocean or someone' s life .
so who are your neighbors ?
that' s bailey , right there .
he' s a matre d ' .
he keeps us all on free meals .
and on the corner there , that' s debbie hunt .
she actually consumes men instead of food .
and that is cliff .
he delivers flowers , has four jobs ... ... works in the coffee shop around the corner .
upstairs is janet livermore .
she works there too .
she' s saving for architecture school .
cliff and janet .
that' s it .
you sound like me talking about my family .
wanna go upstairs while your stuff is still drying ?
that' s a good picture of you .
let me ask you a question .
you think about traffic ?
because i do , constantly .
traffic is caused by the single car driver .
900, 000 single people get in their cars every morning .
they drive and wonder why there' s gridlock .
this is what i' ve been working on .
if you had a supertrain ... ... you give people a reason to get out of their cars .
coffee , great music ... ... they will park and ride .
i know they will .
but i still love my car , though .
well ...
oh .
the sonics .
they' ve got a good team this year .
good thing they traded xavier mcdaniel .
is he a boxer or a basketball player ?
you dare to rip the x man .
kiss at the hotel de ville .
you have this too .
i have this .
and albums .
oh , i miss albums .
i was a deejay in college .
really ?
that' s why i still have records .
so any boyfriends ?
you don' t want to know .
i' ve had bad luck .
but there was this one guy , rich .
all my girlfriends loved him .
that stuff i told you about the money i inherited ?
i made that up .
plus , i got back together with lynn last night .
so you probably want to go ahead and freak out .
oh , man .
that was like a professional hit .
i didn' t wanna get close to anybody for a long time .
and then i ...
i' m talking too much .
no , go ahead .
well , i thought for sure i would meet someone in college .
a perfect combination of mel gibson and holden caulfield ... ... and the sexual revolution would just sweep us both away .
i was a semester too late .
hi .
condoms .
they' re free .
you know , it' s okay to loathe these people .
really ?
there is so much life in you .
and so much emotional larceny in these others .
i' m andy .
i' m linda .
emotional larceny ?
we talked about how passion didn' t matter as much as comfort , stability .
that' s bullshit .
no kidding .
sorry .
it' s cool .
we lived together for two years .
we' re still friends , but ...
i did the same thing .
one day , one of you goes for groceries and never comes back .
everyone i know wants everything to be easy .
why did i have to meet you in a club ?
i don' t know .
oh , i love this song .
my clothes .
this is you ?
this gas guzzling monster ?
the environmentalist ?
i inherited it .
not sure how i feel about that .
so let' s maybe do something this weekend or ...
okay .
i' il call you .
okay .
don' t forget .
i won' t .
good night .
good night .
good night .
listen , next time , why don' t you ... ... park underground ?
i should go .
grab whatever you can .
keep whatever you want .
it' s all yours free , only at shop for less .
i was just nowhere near your neighborhood .
burglar , burglar , burglar , burglar , burglar .
neighbors .
it' s andy .
just calling to make sure you' re okay .
i was thinking about the conversation .
trust him , although he' s putting on moves .
passive aggressively speaking .
i' m a guy .
i don' t like that i know them , but i know .
i think that you can trust him , but you certainly want to ...
if he doesn' t treat you right , i' il kick his ass .
starring fred macmurray .
can you wait ?
just a little longer .
okay ?
whenever , whenever .
you' re amazing .
i feel like i' m being pulled inside you .
we' re being too loud .
what are you thinking right now ?
i play good , hard nosed basketball .
things happen in the game .
nothing you can do .
i don' t go and say , " i' m gonna beat this guy up .
anything else , x ?
yes .
steve , don' t come yet .
god , i' m in love with my neighbor .
why don' t you call me , cliff ?
what can i eat ?
i' m tired of starving myself for this guy .
salad .
i' il have a salad .
if i call him , that' s being desperate .
he' s late or he forgot .
i refuse to call him to remind him he forgot .
if he shows up , i' il listen .
no way do i call him .
of course , men do like to be called .
i' il call him in 10 minutes .
that will be one hour , and that is very late .
he is offiicially very late .
if i make this basket , that' s fate telling me to call him .
two out of three .
wait .
did no basket mean call him or don' t call him ?
busy .
that' s a sign .
that' s fate saying don' t call .
forget it .
i am not desperate .
i have many people to spend time with .
quit getting involved with neighbors .
that broke us up ?
we' re better as friends .
absolutely .
the thing about cliff is , he has all this fierce integrity .
i know .
except when it comes to women .
he likes these club type women ... ... these huge , hourglass , amazon women .
it' s great you' re together , but you' ve got to protect yourself .
so i' m not an amazon woman ?
you' re from the high plains , janet .
i' m so glad i live here .
are my breasts too small for you ?
no .
god .
because , i mean , i look around , and all i see are these ... ... posters and billboards and magazines and tv shows ... ... all with these women with huge breasts .
i guess i just ...
i guess i just wanted to ask .
is that what men really want ?
is that what you want ?
you know ?
don' t lie because when you do , your eye twitches , and i know it anyway .
okay , ask me .
are my breasts too small for you ?
sometimes .
have you had implants before ?
what do you think ?
no .
yes .
well , you take a couple of days and make up your mind .
we skew the size specifically to what you want ... ... by graph .
right .
well , what' s painful ?
it can be mildly painful , and certainly safety is on everybody' s mind ... ... mine in particular .
right .
okay , you take a couple of days and think about it .
all right .
bye bye .
hi .
hi .
heard you on the phone .
i' m in .
i don' t need a couple of days .
how about that ?
maybe for your frame , something a little less hourglass .
if you' re going to have the operation , you know , have the operation .
whoa .
do you jog ?
a little .
see , maybe , here .
split the difference ?
split the difference .
hi , it' s me .
i' m tired of doing the right thing .
i' m tired of waiting for you to call me .
i' m on the bed right now , wearing something really outrageous .
i' ve got no underwear on .
i need to be touched .
i' m burning for you , cliff .
i think you' ve got the wrong number , lady , but i' il be right over .
this guy plays no games .
that' s great .
yeah .
i' ve got to play this one perfectly .
go with it .
what do your instincts say ?
not to listen to you guys .
there you go .
don' t tug at her bra strap .
she wants mystery , drama , excitement .
i know women .
i don' t want drama or excitement .
i just want to trust him .
should i trust him ?
yeah .
not all guys are like luiz .
you' re right .
you' re right .
steve is different .
just follow your instincts .
don' t treat this like casual sex .
casual sex doesn' t even exist anymore .
it' s lethal .
it' s over .
what are you thinking ?
if i had a conversation with god , i would ask him to create this girl .
my chest hurts .
you didn' t , like , leave a note ?
no , i left my blue t shirt .
there are no mistakes .
what ?
what is that ?
what' s that mean ?
give me the phone .
i' m going to call my new semigirlfriend .
you' re gonna scare her off .
she' s beautiful .
anyone would call her .
distinguish yourself by not calling .
yep .
p. s. , that' s how you get her .
no , bailey , you don' t understand .
am i the only one that remembers your last three girlfriends ?
you' re right .
i gotta let this one breathe .
yes .
you' re concerned about dioxins .
let me give you greenpeace' s number .
so how' d it go ?
i got the boat .
the trip to alaska' s set .
oh , great , linda .
that is great .
yeah .
oh , steve on two .
four days he waits to call me .
so , what do i tell him ?
tell him i went out for groceries .
okay .
she went out for groceries .
bye bye .
he' s coming right over .
what do you mean , nothing ?
nothing is wrong .
really .
thanks .
we connected .
this is a small office .
is this because i didn' t call ?
did you call ?
i don' t know why you' re being like this .
i like you .
i' il call you , or you call me .
i' m sorry if i blew it by not calling .
you don' t owe me anything .
is this about your ex who calls ?
andy doesn' t .
ponytail , right ?
no .
mr. sensitive ponytail man .
he is not mr. sensitive ponytail man .
you' re scared of getting close to me .
you don' t know me .
i think i do .
no , you don' t .
look , let' s not play games .
games ?
if i was playing games , i would have waited a week to call .
what i mean is ...
i' ve gotta work , steve .
linda ?
i left my blue t shirt at ...
bye , steve .
why ?
why do you talk such a good game ?
you talk about things that matter , that get me excited , that get me hot .
but it' s like you' re lobotomized .
why can' t i just protect myself ?
why can' t i just be a buddy ?
glad i caught this one in time .
i can' t leave myself open .
it' s better to be the dumper .
mom ...
mom !
yeah .
listen , mom , if he invited you to hawaii , yes , he wants something .
and who cares ?
dad' s been gone for two years .
listen .
listen , mom !
i' m having a bad sugar crash .
do you think you could hold it down ?
wait , mom .
rinse your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher .
i rinsed them , debbie .
you have to rinse off the food or it gets all over .
i found this big , little chunky thing on my glass .
no biggie .
so .
yeah , wish me luck on my video for expect the best .
hi .
this is for expect the best , right ?
i brought clippings .
possible looks for my video .
here we have the edie sedgwick .
you know ?
pseudo brigitte bardot .
or we jet on over to spain for the depressed millionairess .
and i love these earrings that nobody loves but me .
truth ?
truth .
i will create your new look .
i will have men dying at your feet .
ten bucks extra , and brian will shoot your video .
twenty .
he doesn' t even know me .
debbie ... ... he is only like the next martin scor ceese .
okay .
okay , i' m in your hands .
i am debbie hunt .
if you want to see how i look , rewind and freeze frame .
but i am not about looks .
hi .
i crave responsibility , respectability and love .
my goals are serenity and knowledge and men who can understand me .
oh , no druggies , please .
i' m fairly intense , and i' m an advertising exec ... ... at krwe tv .
that' s me .
come to where the flavor is .
come to debbie country .
yeah .
debbie country . " it' s funny .
" doghouse " as an encore ?
six songs .
they want me .
they are just our friends .
" doghouse " as an encore .
you can' t start out with that .
why make them clap so we come out again ?
you don' t get it .
i agree with cliff .
hey , a review of our record .
whoa , read it out loud .
when the shirtless cliff starts to sing ...
wait a minute , man .
i don' t want to hear anything negative .
go on .
other than that , " he was ably backed by stone and jeff ... ... and drummer eddie vedder .
that' s good .
that' s a good review .
a compliment for us is one for you .
no , man .
this negative energy just makes me stronger .
we will not retreat .
this band is unstoppable .
this weekend , we rock portland .
yeah !
okay , are you sure you want to do this ?
yep .
my mind is made up .
want to read a magazine ?
thanks for doing this with me , steve .
i didn' t want you to go alone .
tell me , from a girl' s point of view , what do you want from a guy ?
well , when i first moved out here from tucson ... ... i wanted a guy with ... ... iooks , security , caring .
someone with their own place .
someone who said " bless you " or " gesundheit " when i sneezed .
someone who liked the same things as me , but not exactly .
and someone who loves me .
tall order .
yeah , i scaled it down a little .
what is it now ?
someone who says " gesundheit , " although i prefer " bless you .
it' s nicer .
janet , sorry you had to wait .
dr. jamison .
this is my friend , steve .
doctor .
hi , steve .
come on in .
hey , last chance .
here we go .
i' m going to say something that i haven' t said ... ... in three years of being an hmo .

many , many babes are into that .
yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no , really .
listen , i have friends who would love you .

yeah , that was fun .
doc .
yeah , i know , the operation .
i want cliff to like me the way i am .

a few days later , she leaves the hive .
now she' s ready to mate .
high in the sky , the only male bees , the drones ...
so portland , maybe it wasn' t our city .
man , where are the anthems of our youth ?
what happened to music that meant something ?
the who at the kingdome or kiss at the coliseum .
where is the " misty mountain hop " ?
where is the " iron man " of today ?
we' re not going out tonight , are we ?
look at this .
these bands are bottles of bleach .
it' s beer and lifestyle music .
it' s like the next world war' s gonna be sponsored by ... ... i don' t know , i mean , what ?
we could just take a bath .
just remember one thing , we are loved in belgium and in italy .
the yellow jacket wasp has come looking for food .
the alarm is sounded .
hey , babe , don' t get me sick .
i' m playing this weekend ...
wait a minute .
what am i doing ?
i don' t have to be here .
i could just break up with him .
i' ve always been able to do this .
break up and never look back .
being alone , there' s a certain dignity to it .
hi !
hi , did i overreact ?
do you know who this is ?
we spent a couple of great weeks together .
but whenever things are at their best , i start waiting for them to fall apart .
i can' t fiigure out if i do it to myself or if life does it for me .
i' m a bit late this month , that' s all .

i' m a very meticulous person in appearance and also very precise .
if two people really believe in each other ... ... love can go around the world and through their souls .
but love is very delicate .
i' m looking for a woman who is unpredictable .
someone who is complex .
someone who is willing to experiment .
i like the way the world looks from a bicycle .
i' m looking for someone who feels the same way i do about a bicycle .
am i too intense ?
i can be intensely laid back too .
i am very , very , very lonely .
who ?
definitely the bicycle guy .
the bicycle guy .
he' s like your soul mate .
guy with the bicycle .
nice outfit .
is he late ?
yeah .

i had the coast guard working for us .
it was real exciting .
that' s great .
we don' t have to try and be what we were .

i gotta go piss , man !
let' s go !
linda .
it' s me .
i had to call you .
it' s about midnight .
i was just having many beers and ... ... i wanted to say ...
what i should have said at the dock .
i fucking chickened out .
i lied when i acted casual , like mr. casual ... ... and i should have said it .
you belong with me !
we belong together and ... ... and what really pissed me off is that you thought ... ... i proposed only because you were pregnant .
i' ve got to go piss !
i' ve got to go ...
hey , this is not the bathroom !
and maybe if i' d said this at the dock , it would make a difference because ...
i think we made a big mistake because we had good times and bad times ... ... but we had times .
and i would like to start over .
i would like to be new to you .
i want to be new to you .
i want to be mr. new ... ... so call me back if you want to , but this is the last time i' il call .
and if you really needed to know how i really feel , that' s it .
i love you .
and ...
that' s something you should know , so ...
i won' t bother you again , so good night and goodbye and ... ... i love you .
call me back .
goodbye .
this thing just eats tapes .
we' re talking about 900, 000 to a million people by the time it' s done .
provide an environment safer and better than their cars .
why not , mr. mayor ?
so it' s a train .
a supertrain .
i' ve been burned by this train business before .
you people all seem to forget .
we can change this city .
people love their cars .
yes .
but ...
but if you give them great ...
coffee .
coffee ...
and great music .
if you ...
i' il put it to you like this , and then i' il thank you for your time .
my answer is ... ... no .

i' ve got a special feeling about you .
don' t feel bad about her .
i' il tell you what happened .
kid talks her ear off the whole flight .
dad picks him up .
he' s divorced .
he meets debbie .
look at those fantastic earrings .
and that' s all it took .
debbie was in love .
got back two weeks ago .
he sends her the big basket every day .
every third one ... ... she sends back , just to be mysterious .
i don' t know , games .
he wants her to move to mexico ... ... and if she gets a job at the tv station down there , she' s going .
oh , thanks .
tomorrow , i gotta spell her name in rose petals .
do you believe this job ?
it' s so easy to fall back into old patterns .
back with andy .
one week and we' re already like ... ... one of those old couples , who sit around in denny' s and don' t speak .
what am i doing ?
why did i chicken out ?
do you have the ... ?
no , this is good .
being with andy is like being alone .
together .
at least i' m not out there dating .
love you .
love you too .
what ?
hi .
hey .
hey .
i was worried about you .
i' m fine .
i am great !
been working .
i read half of exodus .
steve , i think you' re going through a phase .
do you realize , janet , that in modern society ... ... there is almost no need to leave the house ?
at all .
steve , you' re wigging .
i' m not wigging .
what , you think i' m wigging ?
this is hang time .
i' m just ...
i' m just regrouping .
i' m spending some time with myself , getting stronger .
thinking about ...
regrouping .
i' m thinking about ... ... how i listened to my instincts , and they were wrong .
the opposite of right .
well , i just wanted to bring you your mail .
and maybe this isn' t the right time to share this with you , but ... ... things do turn around , steve .
i mean , i don' t even think about cliff anymore .
i' m having the best time , on my terms .
you know what else ?
i' m going back to school .
really ?
yeah .
got all my architecture classes .
my first project is ... ... redesigning the fountain so we can sit in it .
that' s good news .
it is .
people need people , steve .
it' s got nothing to do with sex .
maybe 40 percent .
sixty percent .
forget it .
forget it .
tell you what .
if i have any kind of news of any kind ... ... something good and nice that i want to share with you or something ...
i will knock four times , okay ?
it' s gonna be our secret code .
how ?
okay ?
what ?
how ?
how what ?
how will you knock ?
oh .
like that .
okay .
take care of yourself , steve .
please .
in a parallel universe , we' re probably a great couple .
but in this one ...
neighbors .
hi .
hi .
you get my message last night ?
because i called .
i know .
you know , i didn' t appreciate you , even though i thought i did .
i used to live out by the airport , underneath the flight patterns .
it was really noisy with the planes going by all day .
i used to have cookouts , and no one would come because of the noise .
i got used to it .
and then , when i moved ... ... i missed the noise .
i missed those planes .
cliff , what are you talking about ?
i don' t know .
i miss you .
the way you used to look at me ...
don' t .
i' m finally over you .
really ?
yeah .
i mean , you know , i still really do like you , you know ?
i think you' re very ...
what ?
entertaining .
that' s me .
i gotta go .
my break' s over .
janet , you rock my world .
i' m walking down the avenue
and i' m looking at the garbage cans
i' m laughing at the people i see
something like that .
i' m playing with the lyrics .
it' s not set in stone .
give me a call .
i don' t know what you' re doing tonight ... ... but give me a call , huh ?
talk to me , talk to me .
40 rsums , bring me back something .
here we go .
hi .
i was just nowhere near your neighborhood .
i don' t need to be your girlfriend .
i just want to know you again .
what took you so long ?
i was stuck in traffic .
well , that' s the way it happens .
steve' s moving out tomorrow .
they' re finding a place , and i' m happy for them .
coming down .
look out .
no problem .
i may live here forever .
that' s fine .
not everybody needs to be with someone .
for a lot of people , living alone is a nasty hang .
not for me .
my music is all the juice i' il need .
i' m a self contained unit .
i' m a solo artist .
well , i better get going .
i' m going out tonight .
hey .
hey .
going out ?
yep .
you ?
yeah .
that' s a very nice hat , and i don' t mean that in an eddie haskell kind of way .
thanks .
bless you .
thank you .
does everybody go through this ?
no , i think , just us .
i' m going to be celibate forever .
i could spend my life with that person .
all you see is her head , tommy .
i know my type .
met someone new today .
she' s more my type than yours .
you always say they' re your type .
tell me i' m not like shelly .
she should try living alone ...
it took two dates ...
hi , it' s me .
i just thought i' d call ...
you said that i said ...
i don' t play games .
i can' t believe i feel this way !
