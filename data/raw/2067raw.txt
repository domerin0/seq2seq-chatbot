that is thejapanese attack force .
yeah .
i guess now we know .
look , dick .
take personal charge of a rescue team and keep the survivors isolated .
crazy situation .
yes , sir .
you know what i want .
i understand .
keep the fighters airborne to cover the rescue .
aye , aye , skipper .
now track and report all movements of thejapanese task force .
aye , aye , sir .
do you still think it' s a dream ?
it' s a nightmare .
let go !
forget the damn dog !
boss , 36 .
go ahead , 36 .
we got two survivors and now we' re waiting to pick up kag .
kag ?
what the hell is he doing in the water ?
damned if i know .
charlie !
you all right , ma' am ?
how you feeling , sir ?
what the hell kind of machine is this thing ?
and what' s your ship , commander ?
it' s an aircraft carrier , sir .
i' m air wing commander richard owens .
sam chapman .
senator samuel chapman ?
that' s right .
sure am glad you were out here .
yes , sir .
okay , senator , watch yourself .
watch your head .
all right , take it easy .
hang on to me , sir .
you' il be just fine .
it' s all right , ma' am .
go with him .
i' il take the dog , commander .
little bastard .
corporal !
mind the store , ray .
i' m going forward .
holy cow .
it' s the wholejapanese fleet .
have these things returned to thejapanese pilot .
get this translated .
captain' s on the bridge .
mr. lasky .
gentlemen .
captain' s off the bridge .
we can' t ignore it any longer .
every man on this ship knows that we have radar and visual contact with a japanese fleet approaching pearl harbor on december 6 , 1941 .
now , what do we do about it ?
skipper , what we do about it is blow them out of the water .
the u. s. s. <i>nimitz</ i> declares war on thejapanese empire ?
that' s what we' d be doing .
but they haven' t attacked pearl harbor yet .
the only evidence we have that they intend to is in the history books .
it opens up some amazing possibilities .
think of the firepower of the u. s. s. <i>nimitz</ i> back in 1941 .
what kind of possibilities , mr. lasky ?
possibilities for the future , mr. owens .
think of the history of the next 40 years .
i have a suspicion history will be a little more difficult to beat than you imagine , mr. lasky .
i' m talking about the classic paradox of time .
imagine , for example , i go back in time to meet my own grandfather
long before he got married , before he had children .
we have an argument , and i kill him .
now , if that happens , how am i ever gonna be born ?
and if i can never be born , how can i go back in history and meet my very own grandfather ?
i' m not half the theorist you are , mr. lasky but i still have a gut instinct that things only happen once .
and if they have happened , then there' s nothing we can do to change them
nor should we try .
how are you gonna avoid it ?
it' s already happening , and we' re already involved .
for christ' s sake , what is this ?
some half ass princeton debating society ?
we are in a war situation .
this is a united states warship or at least it used to be .
or will be .
or what the hell ever .
oh , goddamn it , you can drive yourself crazy trying to think about this stuff .
jesus , i must be dreaming !
now , hold it .
all right .
let' s all calm down .
let' s take it one step at a time and by the book .
if the united states of america falls under attack our job is to defend her in the past , present or future .
and after that ?
after that , we take our orders from the commander in chief of the united states armed forces .
franklin delano roosevelt ?
everything all right here ?
you in command of this ship ?
oh , hardly .
no , i' m a doctor .
ship' s commander is captain yelland .
i' m sure he' il be down to see you as soon as possible .
i certainly hope so .
meanwhile , you both seem
none the worse for your little mishap .
mishap ?
you call getting a boat shot out from under you and three people dead a mishap ?
are we at war ?
is that what happened ?
i' m not in a position to ...
am i glad to see you .
doctor would you please inform the captain that senator samuel chapman cochairman of the senate defense committee would like to see him at once ?
of course , senator .
doctor , i believe i said at once .
first , a vitamin shot .
now , if you' il both roll up your sleeves .
senator .
no , goddamn it !
now , you can take up your needles , doctor and whatever' s in them and get the hell out of here !
corporal ?
what the hell are we , prisoners ?
holy shit .
<i>smoking lamp is lighted</ i> <i>in all authorized spaces . </ i>
son of a ...
so , history may be tougher to beat than i imagined .
you' re becoming a real pain in the ass , lasky .
you take an awful lot of risks for someone who' s supposed to be intelligent .
do i ?
the attack on pearl harbor was far from a surprise for many people among them , the prominent and ambitious samuel s. chapman who had only two weeks before publicly argued for an increase in our strength in the pacific .
ironically , the senator disappeared and was presumed dead following the attack he had foreseen so clearly .
had he lived , it' s very possible
chapman could have been roosevelt' s running mate in the 1944 election and upon his death , the next president of the united states .
now if that doesn' t come under the heading of trying to beat history
i don' t know what does .
lasky , i realized who we had the moment i heard his name .
why' d you keep it to yourself ?
i don' t have your appetite for playing god with the world .
what was i supposed to do , throw him back in the sea ?
at least that would have preserved the natural order of history as you' ve written it .
go to hell , lasky .
go to hell yourself .
i wanna meet chapman .
goddamn it .
if this wasn' t happening to me , i wouldn' t believe it .
who the hell are these people ?
the navy .
yeah , the navy , yeah .
but what part of it ?
i' ve never seen machines like they got onboard this thing .
and where have they been developing aircraft like that ?
the navy would have to appear before my committee and i' ve never even heard a whisper about it .
rocket planes and that thing they pulled us out of the sea with .
and naming this ship after chester nimitz , an active duty admiral .
what the hell' s going on here ?
yeah , roosevelt .
he owns the military .
that' s it .
that' s exactly who .
f. d. r. has wanted the united states in this war since it started but he knows there' s no way it' s gonna happen except in response to an attack .
you always said thejapanese would attack .
that' s right .
and who' s sitting out here with no press while the white house takes all the credit for raising the alarm and being ready to hit back ?
obviously , we are .
goddamn it !
anything ?
whoever he is , he' s either too scared or too well briefed to talk about it .
excuse me .
all right , corporal .
commander , i demand to know why we' re being held prisoners .
here wait .
i got him .
jesus christ !
no , don' t !
oh , my god .
the prisoner has shot one , maybe two of your men .
move in !
captain , prisoner grabbed a weapon .
he shot one of my men , maybe two .
we' re in position .
the area is sealed off .
stand by .
get lieutenant kajima up here on the double .
can' t we get a translator down here , for god' s sakes ?
how the hell do we know what he' s saying if we can' t understand him ?
we need a translator to tell him we need a translator .
maybe that' s just what he' s trying to tell us .
all right , dick , lieutenant kajima is here .
put it on the box .
ask him what he wants .
he wants access to a radio , sir .
does he say why ?
because he wants to warn his commander about us .
he repeats the demand .
or else ?
he will kill again .
do you think there' s a chance they might believe him ?
there' s no chance if things remain the way they are .
tell him we agree .
you son of a ...
no !
don' t shoot !
back off !
don' t shoot !
back off !
back off !
don' t shoot !
what the hell' s going on down there ?
he says one more attempt to trick him and the girl is dead .
there' il be no tricks .
he can use the radio room if he frees the girl .
<i>says he doesn' t believe you . </ i>
why don' t you tell him what' s going on here , commander ?
you' re an expert on what' s gonna happen tomorrow tell him about it , for god' s sakes .
go on , tell him !
we got nothing to lose !
go ahead , tell him .
26 november , six carriers left the coral isles north ofjapan .
the carriers were the <i>akagi , kaga , shokaku</ i>
<i>zuikaku , hiryu , soryu . </ i>
tomorrow at dawn , these carriers will send 353 planes to attack pearl harbor .
how in the hell do you know all that ?
your code is " climb mount niitaka .
what' s going on ?
please , miss scott , don' t ask me any questions .
there isn' t anything i can tell you at this time .
all right ?
where' s charlie ?
where' s my dog ?
we' il find him , miss scott .
he can' t get off the ship .
<i>casualties will be moved</ i> <i>down to secondary triage . </ i>
i wanna get out of this bathrobe and into some clothes !
will somebody please get me some clothes ?
for god' s sakes !
chief , get the senator some clothes .
yes , sir .
senator , matt yelland , commanding officer .
where and how did you get all this information i' ve been hearing ?
and is it true ?
yes , sir .
did you inform pearl harbor command ?
no , senator .
why the hell not ?
well , the reasons are a little complicated , but , uh , believe me , senator this carrier is capable of handling any attack should it occur .
one carrier against a whole fleet ?
what kind of an idiot do you take me for ?
senator , calm down .
the hell with you .
tell pearl harbor what' s happening here , or i' il talk to them .
very well .
dan , set up the communications in my inport cabin .
wouldn' t you like to talk to them with some clothes on ?
thank you , captain .
follow me , sir .
are you all right ?
yes , sir , i' m fine .
can you do that , captain ?
contact pearl harbor back in 1941 .
i think so .
then what do you do ?
one step at a time .
yeah .
like a minefield .
this is , uh , senator samuel s. chapman of the united states senate onboard the aircraft carrier <i>nimitz . </ i>
captain yelland is here with me .
<i>you' re on what ? </ i>
i repeat .
i am senator samuel s. chapman onboard the u. s. s. <i>nimitz . </ i>
<i>all right, </ i> <i>whoever the hell you are</ i> <i>use of military frequencies</ i> <i>by unauthorized personnel is a felony . </ i>
now just a minute here , sir .
<i>as we have no aircraft carrier</ i> nimitz <i>and no captain yelland</ i>
<i>i suggest , asshole , that you stop</ i> <i>impersonating some other asshole</ i> <i>and get off the air . </ i>
<i>you' re wasting our time . </ i>
how dare you talk to me that way !
captain , tell him who you are .
speak to them !
you , what are you doing here ?
you' re a civilian .
yes , sir , i' m with the department of def ...
i mean , the navy department .
that' s more like it .
what' s going on here ?
i' m afraid i' m just an observer here , sir .
i couldn' t tell you anything more than you already know .
what' s happening here ?
who are you people ?
join him in his inport cabin .
thank you .
i' il wait outside while you change .
please , i really don' t want to be left alone right now .
i' il just be a minute .
just exactly what is it you do for the senator , miss scott ?
i work for him , commander .
i' d like to think i' m more than just a secretary .
i write most of his speeches , and in general , i' m his assistant .
it' s quite an accomplishment for a woman in your day ... this day and age .
let me tell you something .
i' m ambitious and very capable .
that' s a combination that' s not much appreciated .
it' s a man' s world .
i' m sure you' il agree .
it certainly is , miss scott .
i spent a lot of time trying to hide the way i look hoping to be recognized for my ability .
how' s it going so far ?
well , let me put it this way .
if the way i look gets me in the door , then god help them when i get through .
you' re a remarkable woman , miss scott .
shall we ?
yeah .
<i>enemy fleet bears 042 degrees . </ i>

miss scott , i' m matt yelland , skipper of this ship .

very well .

yes , sir .
follow this officer .
he' il see that you' re fully equipped and then escort you to the hangar deck .
thank you , captain .
charlie ?
forget about the dog .
he' il be all right .
wait a minute , captain .
i think you' re making a big mistake here .
that man mysteriously disappeared on december 7 , 1941 .
that' s today , sir .
now , at the present time , he is the front running candidate for the vice presidential spot on the democratic ticket in 1944 .
and if he survives , he' s almost certain to become the president of the united states when roosevelt dies in april of 1945 .
sir , don' t you think he' d be a whole lot safer to stay on the ship for the time being ?
mr. lasky , my job is to make decisions here , now not worry about what politician may be in the white house
four years from now or 40 years ago .
but , sir ...
and right now , i don' t like having two civilians on my ship when i' m about to do battle .
you' ve got three civilians .
mr. lasky , you' re free to go with them if you like .
dick .
just got enough time to drop them off on a deserted spot on this island .
not pearl , sir ?
hell , no .
they' il be a whole lot safer there .
we' il equip them to look after themselves till it' s over .
i' il feel a lot easier with them off my hands .
yes , sir .
be sure you' re back by 0700 .
i want my best man commanding that strike force .

in the past few hours , many things have happened but rumors of nuclear attacks and a third world war are totally untrue .
