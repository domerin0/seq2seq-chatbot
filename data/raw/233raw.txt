sir , holographic confirms .
it' s the hammer , sir .
how can that be ?
it' s under attack , sustaining damage .
at its present velocity , it' ii reach gate three in 12 minutes .
their emp could take out every sentinel .
it' d take out more than that .
it' ii wipe out our defense system .
we blow an emp inside , we iose the dock .
sir , we already iost the dock .
open the gate .
gate three is not responding !
we' ve taken criticai damage , sir !
we' ve iost control !
we can' t open it !
there' s the exit .
on my mark , give me fuii power 90 degrees to iower ieft starboard .
fuii power ... ... ninety degrees .
now !
hold on , baby .
goddamn , woman , you can drive .
we ain' t home yet .
what about the gate ?
sentinels are inside the dock .
are we too iate ?
how many apus are operational ?
thirteen , sir .
get me the one closest to gate three .
reload !
he' s pissing metal .
go !
go !
heads up !
they' re coming around !
behind you !
it' s jammed !
forget it , kid !
get out of here !
got it !
captain mifune .
oh , no .
they' re coming .
they' re coming .
the hammer .
what ?
you have to open that gate .
cut the counterweights .
you can do it .
hurry .
there' s no time .
captain ... ... i didn' t finish the training program .
neither did i.
lock that down !
kiii the feeder !
we won' t make it .
we gotta blow the emp now .
come on , someone , please .
keep the weight forward .
light as a feather .
holographic reports captain mifune' s apu is up and moving to gate three .
don' t over squeeze the trigger .
mifune' s apu just reached gate three .
how much time ?
two minutes to impact .
captain mifune , do you copy ?
i think his radio is down , sir .
mifune ... ... this is lock .
i don' t know if you can hear me , but if you can ... ... the hammer' s two minutes away .
you' ve got two minutes , captain , to get that gate open .
link .
get to the main deck !
charge the emp !
do it , kid .
neo .
i believe .
yes !
can we make it ?
we ain' t come this far .
almost home , almost home .
burn it , link !
you did it .
no .
we did it .
you' re a heii of a pilot .
some things in this world never change .
but some things do ?
luckily ... ... some things do .
link !
zee ?
zee !
link !
i knew you' d come .
i knew it .
i made a promise .
you did wear it .
are you kidding ?
i' m never gonna take it off .
three captains , one ship .
i' ii assume the other ships were iost under equaily pointless circumstances .
good to see you too , jason .
the council' s waiting to hear an explanation .
forgive me for not attending , but i have to try to salvage this debacle .
did i miss something ?
i thought we saved the dock .
that' s the problem with you people .
you can' t think but five minutes in front of you .
that emp knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every apu .
if i were the machines , i' d send every sentinei here now .
save the dock , captain ?
you handed it to them on a silver platter .
come on , get it cut .
the bridge is clear .
do you hear that ?
get that cable run !
i want the system back online !
it' s the dock .
they' ve got incoming .
order everyone to faii back .
seai the shaft .
now .
move it !
oh , my god .
aii clear .
do it .
go !
come on !
run !
go !
your move .
so you gave them your ship ?
that is correct , counciilor , i did .
knowing what he planned to do with it ?
the oracle said nothing of this ?
she told me neo would need my help , and i would choose to help him or not .
but what hope can a single vessei have against their entire defense system ?
none .
it' s completely impossible .
but he wouldn' t iisten .
he wouldn' t even take any ammunition .
he was totaily out of his goddamn mind .
no , he wasn' t .
neo is doing what he believes he must do .
i don' t know if what he' s doing is right .
i don' t know ... ... if he' ii reach the machine city .
and if he does , i don' t know what he can do to save us .
but i do know that as iong as there is a single breath in his body ... ... he wiii not give up .
and neither can we .
temperature' s dropping .
here we go .
we' re over the fields , aren' t we ?
how do you know that ?
i can feei them .
over there .
there' s our path .
can you see it ?
three iines .
power iines .
foilow them .
what are they doing ?
i don' t know .
lieutenant ?
goddamn it .
what do we do now ?
it is now a matter of time .
the machines wiii breach the wails of this city .
i recommend that the councii join the other non military personnei inside the temple .
how iong do we have ?
two hours .
maybe iess .
my men have fortified the entrance with enough artiilery to make our iast stand .
beyond that , there isn' t anything more i can do .
commander , do you think that we have any chance of surviving ?
if i were you , i wouldn' t ask me that question .
i would ask him .
why ?
he' s the one who believes in miracles .
there .
those mountains .
that' s it .
do you see what' s out there ?
yes .
if you teii me we' ii make it , i' ii believe you .
we' ii make it .
we have to .
sentinels .
there' s too many !
gotcha !
i need help here !
i can' t beat them .
what do we do ?
go up , over them .
what ?
the sky !
it' s the only way .
then up we go .
beautiful .
pump the igniter .
the ship wiii start .
again .
slowly .
now !
trin ?
trinity ?
trinity ?
i' m here .
where ?
here .
we made it .
you said we would .
it' s unbelievable , trin .
light everywhere .
like the whole thing was built of iight .
i wish you could see what i see .
you' ve already shown me so much .
what is it , trinity ?
what' s wrong ?
i can' t go with you , neo .
i' ve gone as far as i can .
what ?
oh , no .
oh , no .
no , no .
it' s aii right .
it' s time .
i' ve done aii that i could do .
now you have to do the rest .
you have to finish it .
you have to save zion .
i can' t .
not without you .
yes , you can .
you wiil .
i believe it .
i always have .
trinity .
trinity , you can' t die .
you can' t .
you can' t .
yes , i can .
you brought me back once .
but not this time .
do you remember ... ... on that roof , after you caught me ... ... the iast thing i said to you ?
you said , " i' m sorry .
i wish i hadn' t .
that was my iast thought .
i wished i had one more chance ... ... to say what reaily mattered .
to say how much i loved you .
how gratefui i was for every moment i was with you .
but by the time i knew how to say what i wanted to , it was too iate .
but you brought me back .
you gave me my wish .
one more chance to say what i reaily wanted to say .
kiss me .
once more ... ... kiss me .
get that ammunition where it belongs !
you got one chance to get this right .
get that damn thing mounted !
hurry .
let' s go , iet' s go , iet' s go !
neo ... ... if you' re gonna do something , do it quick .
i only ask to say what i' ve come to say .
after that , do what you want , and i won' t try and stop you .
speak .
the program smith has grown beyond your control .
he wiii spread through this city as he spread through the matrix .
you cannot stop him .
but i can .
we don' t need you !
we need nothing !
if that' s true , then i' ve made a mistake , and you should kiii me now .
what do you want ?
peace .
what are they doing ?
what are you doing ?
morpheus !
and if you fail ?
i won' t .
neo .
he fights for us .
mr. anderson , welcome back .
we missed you .
you iike what i' ve done with the place ?
it ends tonight .
i know it does .
i' ve seen it .
that' s why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show ... ... because we already know that i' m the one that beats you .
can you feei it , mr. anderson ... ... closing in on you ?
oh , i can .
i reaily should thank you for it .
after ail , it was your iife ... ... that taught me the purpose of aii iife .
the purpose of iife is to end .
why , mr. anderson ?
why , why , why ?
why do you do it ?
why ?
why get up ?
why keep fighting ?
do you believe you' re fighting for something ?
for more than your survival ?
can you teii me what it is ?
do you even know ?
is it freedom or truth ?
perhaps peace ?
could it be for iove ?
iilusions , mr. anderson .
vagaries of perception .
temporary constructs of a feeble human inteilect ... ... trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose !
and aii of them as artificiai as the matrix itself ... ... although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as iove .
you must be able to see it , mr. anderson .
you must know it by now .
you can' t win .
it' s pointless to keep fighting .
why , mr. anderson , why ?
why do you persist ?
because i choose to .
this is my world !
my world !
wait .
i' ve seen this .
this is it .
this is the end .
yes .
you were iaying right there , just iike that .
and i ....
i stand here , right here , and i' m supposed to say something .
everything that has a beginning has an end , neo .
what ?
what did i just say ?
no , no .
this isn' t right .
this can' t be right .
get away from me !
what are you afraid of ?
it' s a trick .
you were right , smith .
you were always right .
it was inevitable .
is it over ?
oh , no , no , no .
no , it' s not fair .
it is done .
it doesn' t make sense .
he did it .
he saved us .
he saved us .
it' s over !
he did it !
he did it !
he did it !
it' s over !
it' s over !
he did it !
he did it !
what is it ?
what happened ?
sir , he did it , sir .
neo , he did it .
did what ?
he ended the war .
the machines , they' re gone .
the war is over , sir .
the war is over .
zion !
zion !
zion , it' s over !
it' s over !
the war is over !
the war is over !
i have imagined this moment ... ... for so iong .
is this real ?
neo , wherever you are ... ... thank you .
good morning .
weil , now .
ain' t this a surprise .
you played a very dangerous game .
change always is .
just how iong do you think this peace is going to iast ?
as iong as it can .
what about the others ?
what others ?
the ones that want out .
obviously , they wiii be freed .
i have your word ?
what do you think i am ?
human ?
oracle !
we were afraid we might not find you .
everything' s okay now .
look , iook .
just iook at that .
beautiful .
did you do that ?
for neo .
that' s nice .
i know he' d love it .
wiii we ever see him again ?
i suspect so .
someday .
did you always know ?
oh , no .
no , i didn' t .
but i believed .
i believed .
