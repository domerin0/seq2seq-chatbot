hello .
my name' s forrest forrest gump .
do you want a chocolate ?
i could eat about a million and a halfofthese .
my mama always said
iife was like a box of chocolates .
you never know what you' re going to get .
those must be comfortable shoes .
i bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing .
i wish i had shoes like that .
my feet hurt .
mama always said there' s an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes .
where they' re going , where they' ve been .
i' ve worn lots ofshoes .
i bet if i think about it real hard
i could remember my fi rst pair ofshoes .
mama said they' d take me anywhere .
shesaid th ey was my magic shoes .
all right , forrest , open your eyes now .
let' s take a little walk around .
how do those feel ?
his legs are strong , mrs. gump , as strong as i' ve ever seen .
but his back' s as crooked as a politician .
but we' re going to straighten him right up , aren' t we , forrest ?
forrest !
now , when i was a baby ,
mama named me after the great civil war hero
general nathan bedford forrest .
general nathan bedford forrest .
she said we was related to him in some way .
what he did was , hetarted up this club called the ku klux klan .
they' d all dress up in their robes and th eirbed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something .
they' d even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around .
and , anyway , that' show i got my name forrest gump .
mama said the forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that , well , that just don' t make no sense .
this way .
hold on .
ugh !
all right .
what are y' all staring at ?
haven' t you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before ?
don' t ever let anybody tell you they' re better than you , forrest .
if god intended everybody to be the same , he' d have given us all braces on our legs .
mama always hada way of explaining things so i could understand them .
we lived about a quarter mile off route 17 , about a halfmile from the town of greenbow , alabama .
that' s in the county of greenbow .
our house had been in mama' s family since her grandpa' s grandpa' s grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago .
since it was just me and mama and we had all these empty rooms ,
mama decided to let those rooms out , mostly to people passing through ,
iike from , oh , mobile , montgomery , places like that .
that' show me and mama got money .
mama was a real smart lady .
remember what i told you , forrest .
you' re no different than anybody else is .
did you hear what i said , forrest ?
you' re the same as everybody else .
you are no different .
your boy' s ... different , mrs. gump .
his i. q is 75 .
well , we' re all different ,
mr. hancock .
she wan ted me to have the finest education so she to ok me to the greenbow county central school .
i met the principal and all .
i want to show you something , mrs. gump .
now , this is normal .
forrest is right here .
the state require s a minimum i. q of 80 to attend public school .
mrs. gump , he' s going to have to go to a special school .
now , he' il bejust fine .
what does normal mean anyway ?
he might be ... a bit on the slow side , but my boy forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else .
he' s not going to some special school to learn how to retread tires .
we' re talking about five little points here .
there must be something can be done .
we' re a progressive school system .
we don' t want to see anybody left behind .
is there a mr. gump , mrs. gump ?
he' s on vacation .
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
well , your mama sure does care about your schooling , son .
mmm mmm mmm .
you don' t say much , do you ?
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
eee !
finally , he had to try .
it looked easy , but ... oh , what happened .
first they
mama , what' s vacation mean ?
vacation ?
where daddy went ?
vacation' s when you go somewhere ... and you don' t ever come back .
anyway , i guess you could say me and mama was on our own .
but we didn' t mind .
our house was never empty .
there was always folks coming and going .
supper !
it' s supper , everyone !
that sure looks special .
sometimes , we had so many people staying with us that every room was filled , with travelers , you know , folks living out of their suitcases and hat cases and sample cases .
forrest gump , it' s suppertime !
forrest ?
one time , a young man was staying with us , and he had him a guitar case .
# well , you ain' t never caught a rabbit #
# and you ain' t no #
# friend of mine ##
forrest ,
i told you not to bother this nice young man .
no , that' s all right , ma' am .
i was showing him a thing or two on the guitar .
all right .
supper' s ready if y' all want to eat .
yeah , that sounds good .
thank you , ma' am .
say , man , show me that crazy little walk you did there .
slow it down some .
# you ain' t nothing but #
i liked that guitar .
it so unded good .
is tarted moving around to the music , swinging my hips .
# cryin ' all the time ##
this one night , me and mama was out shopping , and we walked by vincy' s furniture andapplian ce store , and guess what ?
# you ain' t nothin ' but a hound dog #
# cryin' all the time #
# you ain' t nothin ' but a hound dog #
this is not for children' s eyes .
# cryin' all the time #
some years later , that handsome young man who they called the king , well , he sung too many songs .
had him self a heart attack or something .
it must be hard being a king .
you know , it' s funny how you remember some things , but some things you can' t .
you do your very best now , forrest .
i sure will , mama .
i remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well .
are you coming along ?
mama said not to be taking rides from strangers .
this is the bus to school .
i' m forrest forrest gump .
i' m dorothy harris .
well , now we ain' t strangers anymore .
this seat' s taken .
it' s taken .
you can' t sit here .
you know , it ' s funny what a young man recollects ,
' cause i don ' t remember being born .
i don' t recall what i got for my first christmas , and i don' t know when i went on my first outdoor picnic , but i do remember the first time i heard the sweetest voice in the wide world .
you can sit here if you want .
i had never seen anything so beautiful in my life .
she was like an angel .
well , are you going to sit down or aren' t you ?
what' s wrong with your legs ?
um , nothing at all , thank you .
my legs are just fine and dandy .
i just sat next to her on that bus and had a conversation all the way to school .
my back' s crooked like a question mark .
next to mama , no one ever talked to me or asked me questions .
are you stupid or something ?
mama says , " stupid is as stupid does .
i' m jenny .
i' m forrest forrest gump .
from that day on , we was always together .
jenny and me was like peas and carrots .
she taught me how to climb .
come on , forrest , you can do it .
i showed her how to dangle .
a good little ...
she help edme learn how to read , and i showed her how to swing .
sometimes , we' d just sitout and wait for the stars .
mama' s going to worry about me .
just stay a little longer .
for some reason , jenny didn ' t never want to go home .
o. k. , jenny , i' il stay .
she was my most special friend .
my only friend .
now , my mama always told me that miracles happen every day .
some people don' t think so , but they do .
hey , dummy !
are you dumb , or just plain stupid ?
look , i' m forrest gimp .
just run away , forrest .
run , forrest !
run away !
hurry !
get the bikes !
let' s get him !
come on !
look out , gump !
we' re going to get you !
run , forrest , run !
run , forrest !
come back here , you !
ha ha ha ha ha !
run , forrest !
run !
now , you wouldn' t believe if i told you ... but i could run like the wind blows .
from that day on , if i was going somewhere ,
i was running .
that boy sure is a running fool .
now , remember how i told you that jenny never seemed to want to go home ?
she lived in a house that was as old as alabama .
her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5 , and her daddy was some kind of a farmer .
jenny ?
he was a very loving man .
he was always kissing and touching her and her sisters .
and then this one time ,
jenny wasn' t on the bus to go to school .
jenny , why didn' t you come to school today ?
shh .
daddy' s taking a nap .
jenny !
come on !
jenny , where' d you run to ?
you better get back here , girl !
where you at ?
jenny !
jenny , where you at ?
jenny !
pray with me , forrest .
pray with me .
jenny !
dear god , make me a bird so i can fly far , far , far away from here .
dear god , make me a bird so i can fly far .
mama always said god is mysterious .
jenny !
he didn ' t turn jenny in to a bird that day .
instead , he had the police say
jenny didn' t have to stay in that house no more .
she was to live with her grandma , just over on creek more avenue , which made me happy , ' cause she was so close .
some nights ,
jenny' d sneak out and come on over to my house , just' cause she said she was scared .
scared of what , i don ' t know .
but i think it was her grandma' s dog .
he was a mean dog .
anyway , jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school .
hey , stupid !
quit it !
run , forrest , run !
hey , didn' t you hear me , stupid ?
run , forrest !
get in the truck !
come on !
he' s getting away !
move it !
run , forrest !
run !
ha , ha !
move it !
move it !
you better be runnin ' !
yeah !
whoo hoo !
go !
run , forrest !
now , it used to be
i ran to get where i was going .
i never thought it would take me anywhere .
ohh !
who in the hell is that ?
that there is forrest gump , coach .
just a local idiot .
and can you believe it ?
i got to go to college , too .
forrest , move it !
run !
o. k. !
run !
run , you stupid son of a bitch !
run !
run , son of a bitch , run !
go !
run !
run !
run !
go !
he must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive , but he sure is fast .
now , maybe it' s just me , but college was very confusing times .
federal troops , enforcing a court order , in tegrated the university of alabama today .
two negroes were admitted , but only after go vern or george wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the school house door .
i take it from that statement ...
earl , what' s going on ?
coons are trying to get into school .
coons ?
when raccoons tried getting on our back porch ,
mama just chased them off with a broom .
not raccoons , you idiot .
niggers .
and they want to go to school with us .
with us ?
they do ?
shortly after govern or wallace had carried out his promise to block the door way ,
kennedy ordered these cretary of defense to use military force .
here , by video tape , is the encounter by general graham , commander of the national guard , and govern or wallace .
because these national guardsmen are here today as federal soldiers for alabama , and they live within our borders .
they are our brothers .
we are winning in this fight , because we are awakening the american people to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times that is so evident today
a trend to ward military dictatorship in this country .
and so , at day' s end , the university of alabama in tuscaloosa had been desegregated , and students jimmy hood and vivian malone had been signed up for summer classes .
ma' am , you dropped your book .
ma' am .
govern or wallace did what he promised .
by being on the tuscaloosa campus , he kept the mob ...
say , wasn' t that gump ?
naw , that couldn' t be .
it sure as hell was .
a few years later , that angry little man at the school house door thought it' d be a good idea and ran for president .
but somebody thought that it wasn' t .
but he didn' t die .
my bus is here .
is it the number 9 ?
no , it' s the number 4 .
it was nice talking to you .
i remember when that happened , when wallace got shot .
i was in college .
did you go to a girls ' college or a girls ' and boys ' together college ?
it was coed .
' cause jenny went to a college i couldn' t go to .
it was a college just for girls .
but i' d go and visit her every chance i got .
# i don' t know why i love you #
# but i do #
# i don' t know why i cry so #
# but i do #
# i only know i know that ... #
ohh !
that hurts .
# but i don' t know why i love you #
# but i do #
forrest !
forrest !
forrest , stop it !
stop it !
what are you doing ?
he was hurting you .
no , he wasn' t !
get over there !
billy , i' m sorry .
just keep away from me .
don' t be such don' t go .
billy , wait a second .
he doesn' t know any better .
forrest , why' d you do that ?
i brought you some chocolate .
i' m sorry .
i' il go back to my college now .
forrest
look at you .
come on .
come on .
is this your own room ?
shh !
do you ever dream , forrest ... about who you' re going to be ?
who i' m going to be ?
yeah .
aren' t i going to be me ?
you' il always be you , just another kind of you .
you know ?
i want to be famous .
i want to be a singer like joan baez .
i just want to be ... on an empty stage with my guitar , my voice .
just me .
and i want to reach people on a personal level .
i want to be able to say things , just one to one .
have you ever been with a girl , forrest ?
i sit next to them in my home economics class all the time .
oh
oh
oh , i' m sorry .
it' s o. k.
sorry .
oh
oh
it' s all right .
it' s o. k.
oh , i' m dizzy .
i' il bet that never happened in home ec .

college ran by real fast
' cause i played so much football .
th eyeven put me on a thing called the all america team where you get to meet the president of the united states .
president kennedy met with the collegiate all american football team at the oval office today .
now the really good thing about meeting the presiden t of the united states is the food .
they put you in this little room with just about anything you' d want to eat or drink .
but since , number one ,
i wasn ' t hungry but thirsty , and number two , they was free ,
i must have drank me about 15 dr. peppers .
how does it feel to be an all american ?
it' s an honor , sir .
how does it feel to be an all american ?
very good , sir .
how does it feel to be an all american ?
very good , sir .
congratula tions .
how do you feel ?
i got to pee .
i believe he said he had topee .
some time later , for noparticular reason , somebody shot that nice young president when he was riding in his car .
and a few years after that , somebody shot his little brother , too , only he was in a hotel kitchen .
must be hard being brothers .
i wouldn' t know .
forrest gump .
now can you believe it ?
after only five years of playing football ,
i got a college degree .
congratulations , son .
mama was so proud .
forrest , i' m so proud of you .
i' il hold this for you .
congratulations , son .
have you given any thought to your future ?
thought ?
hello .
i' m forrest .
forrest gump .
nobody gives a horse' s shit who you are , pus ball !
you' re not even a lowlife , scum sucking maggot !
get your maggoty ass on the bus !
you' re in the army now !
seat' s taken .
taken .
at first it seemed like i made a mistake .
it was only my induction day , and i was getting yelled at .
sit down if you want to .
i didn' t know who i might meet or what they might ask .
you ever been on a real shrimp boat ?
no .
but i been on a real big boat .
i' m talking about a shrimp catching boat .
i been working on shrimp boats all my life .
i started out on my uncle' s boat when i was about maybe 9 .
i was just looking into buying my own boat and got drafted .
my given name is benjamin buford blue .
people call me bubba , just like one of them old red neck boys .
can you believe that ?
my name' s forrest gump .
people call me forrest gump .
so bubba was from bayou la ba tre , alabama , and his mama cooked shrimp .
and her mama before her cooked shrimp , and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp , too .
bubba' s family knew everything there was to know about the shrimping business .
i know everything there is to know about the shrimping business .
i' m going into the shrimping business for myself after i get out ofthe army .
o. k.
gump !
what' s your sole purpose in this army ?
to do whatever you tell me , drill sergeant !
god damn it , gump , you' re a goddamn genius .
that' s the most outstanding answer i' ve ever heard .
you must have a goddamn l . q of 160 .
you are goddamn gifted , private gump .
listen up , people !
now for some reason , i fit in the army
like one of them round pegs .
it' s not really hard .
you just make your bed neat , remember to stand up straight , and always answere very question with " yes , drill sergeant .
is that clear ?
yes , drill sergeant !
what you do is drag your nets along the bottom .
on a good day , you can catch over a hundred pounds of shrimp .
everything goes all right , 2 men shrimping 10 hours ,
less what you spends on gas
done , drill sergeant !
gump !
why did you put that weapon together so quickly ?
you told me to , drill sergeant .
jesus h. christ .
this is a new company record .
if it wasn' t a waste of a fine enlisted man ,
i' d recommend you for o. c. s. , private gump .
you' re going to be a general someday !
now disassemble your weapon and continue !
anyway , like i was saying , shrimp is the fruit of the sea .
you can barbecue it , boil it , broil it , bake it , saute it .
they' s , uh , shrimp kabobs , shrimp creole , shrimp gumbo , pan fried , deep fried , stir fried .
there' s pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp , coconut shrimp , pepper shrimp , shrimp soup , shrimp stew , shrimp salad , shrimp in potatoes , shrimp burger , shrimp sandwich .
that that' s about it .
night time in the army is alonely time .
we' d lay there in our bunks , and i' d miss my mama , and i' d miss jenny .
hey , gump .
get a load of the tits on her .
turns out ...
jenny had gotten in to some trouble over some photos of her in her college sweater .
and she was thrown out of school .
# my baby does the hanky panky #
but that wasn' t a bad thing ,
' cause a man who owns a theater in memphis , tennessee , saw those photos and offered jenny a job singing in a show .
the first chance i got ,
i took the bus up to memphis to see her perform in that show .
that was amber , amber flame .
give her a big hand .
and now , for your listening and viewing pleasure , direct from hollywood , california , our very own beatnik beauty .
let' s give a big round of applause to the luscious bobbie dylan .
# how many roads must a man walk down #
# before you can call him a man ? #
# yes , and how many seas must the white dove sail #
her dream had come true .
# before she sleeps in the sand ? #
she was a folk singer .
# yes , and how many times #
# must the cannon balls fly #
# before they' re fo rever banned ? #
shake it up now .
somebody get her a harmonica .
# the answer , my friend #
# is blowin ' in the wind ##
this ain' t captain kangaroo .

now they told us that vietnam was going to be very different from the united states of america .
except for all the beer cans and barbecues , it was .
hey , i' il bet there' s shrimp all in these waters .
they tell me these vietnams is good shrimp .
after we win this war and we take over everything , we can get american shrimpers out here and shrimp these waters .
just shrimp all the time , man .
you must be my fngs .
morning , sir .
oh , get your hands down .
do not salute me .
there are goddamn snipers all around this are a who' d love to grease an officer .
i' m lieutenant dan taylor .
welcome to fort platoon .
what' s wrong with your lip ?
i was born with big gums , sir .
well , you better tuck that in .
gonna get that caught on a trip wire .
where are you boy s from in the world ?
alabama , sir !
alabama , sir !
you twins ?
no .
we are not relations , sir .
look , it' s pretty basic here .
you stick with me and learn from the guys who' ve been in country a while , you' il be all right .
there is one item of g. i. gear that can be the difference between life and death
socks .
cushioned sole , o. d. green .
try and keep your feet dry .
when we' re out humpin ' , change your socks whenever we stop .
the mekong will eat a grunt' s feet right off his legs .
sergeant sims .
god damn it , where' s that sling rope i said to order ?
i put in the requisitions .
well , you call those sons of bitches
lieutenant dan sure knew his stuff .
i felt real lucky he was my lieutenant .
he was from a long , great military tradition .
somebody in his family had fought and died in every ... single ...
american war .
god damn it , kick some ass .
get on it !
i guess you could say he had a lot to live up to .
so , you boys from arkansas , huh ?
well ,
i been through there .
little rock' s a fine town .
now , shake down your gear .
see the platoon sergeant .
draw what you need for the field .
if you boys are hungry , we got steaks burning right over here .
two standing orders in this platoon 1 take care of your feet , 2 try not to do anything stupid ,
like getting yourself killed .
i sure hope i don' t let him down .
i got to see a lot of the country side .
we would take these real long walks .
# there must be some kind of way #
# out of here #
# said the joker to the thief #
and we were always lookin ' for this guy named charlie .
# there' s too much confusion #
# i can' t get no relief ##
hold it up !
hold up , boys !
it wasn' t always fun .
lieutenant dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock or a trail or the road , so he' d tell us to get down , shut up .
get down !
shut up !
so we did .
now i don' t know much about anything , but i think some of america' s best young men served in this war .
there was dallas from phoenix .
cleveland  he was from detroit .
hey , tex .
hey , tex .
what the hell' s going on ?
and tex was
well , i don' t remember where tex come from
ah , nothing .
fourth platoon , on your feet .
y' all got 10 clicks to go to that river .
move out .
1 , 2 !
hup !
step it up !
look alive out there .
the good thing about vietnam is there was always someplace to go .
fire in the hole !
gump , check out that hole .
and there was always something to do .
mount' em up !
spread out !
cover his back !
one day it started raining , and it didn' t quit for four months .
we' ve been through every kind of rain there is
little bitty stinging rain and big old fat rain , rain that flew in side ways , and sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath .
shoot , it even rained at night .
hey , forrest .
hey , bubba .
i' m going to lean up against you .
you lean up against me .
this way we don' t have to sleep with our heads in the mud .
you know why we' re a good partnership , forrest ?
' cause we be watching out for one another ,
like brothers and stuff .
hey , forrest , something i been thinking about .
i got a very important question to ask you .
how would you like to go into the shrimping business with me ?
o. k.
man , i tell you what .
i got it all figured out , too .
so many pounds of shrimp will pay off the boat .
so many pounds for gas .
we' il live right on the boat .
we ain' t got to pay no rent .
we can just work it together , split everything right down the middle .
man , i' m telling you , 50 50 .
hey , forrest , all the shrimp you can eat .
that' s a fine idea .
bubba did have a fine idea .
i even wrote jenny and told her all about it .
i sent her letters
not every day , but almost .
i told her what i was doing and asked her what she was doing and told her how i thought about her always .
and how i was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time .
i' d always let her know that i was o. k.
then i' d sign each letter " love , forrest gump .
# there' s somethin ' happenin ' here #
this one day , we was out walking like always , and then , just like that , somebody turned off the rain , and the sun come out .
# i got to beware ##
ambush !
take cover !
get that pig up here , god damn it !
forrest !
you okay ?
strong arm , strong arm !
hey !
we got a man down !
strong arm , this is leg lima 6 !

i ran and ran just like jenny told me to .
i ran so far so fast that pretty so on i was all by myself , which was a bad thing .
bubba .
bubba was my best good friend .
i had to make sure he was o. k.
where the hell are you ?
bubba !
and on my way back to find bubba , well , there was this boy laying on the ground .
tex .
o. k.
i couldn' t let him lay there all alone , scared the way he was , so i grabbed him up and run him out of there .
every time i went back looking for bubba , somebody else was saying ,
help me , forrest , help me !
o. k. here .
here .
no sweat , man .
lay back .
you' il be o. k.
i started to get scared that i might never find bubba .
i know my position is danger close !
we got charlie all over this area .
i got to have those fast movers in here now .
over .
lieutenant dan , coleman' s dead !
i know he' s dead !
my whole goddamn platoon is wiped out !
god damn it !
what are you doing ?

get away .
just leave me here !
get out !
aah !
god , i said leave me here , god damn it !
leglima , this is strong arm .

then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me .
aah !
something bit me !
aah !
aah !

aah !
i can' t leave the platoon .
i told you to leave me there , gump .

gump , damn it , put me down .

i didn' t ask you to pull me out of there , god damn you !

if i' d have known this was going to be the last time me and bubba was gonna talk ,
i' d of thought of something better to say .
hey , bubba .
hey , forrest .
forrest
why did this happen ?
you got shot .
then bubba said something i won' t ever forget .
i want to go home .
bubba was my best good friend .
and even i know that ain' t something you can find just around the corner .
bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain , but instead , he died right there by that river in vietnam .
that' s all i have to say about that .
it was a bullet , wasn' t it ?
a bullet ?
that jumped up and bit you .
oh .
yes , sir .
bit me directly in the but tocks .
they said it was a million dollar wound , but ... the army must keep that money ,
' cause i still ain' t seen a nicke i of that million dollars .
the only good thing about being wounded in the but tocks is the ice cream .
they gave me all the ice cream i could eat .
and guess what ?
a good friend of mine was in the bed right next door .
lieutenant dan , i got you some ice cream .
lieutenant dan , ice cream !
it' s time for your bath , lieutenant .
harper !
cooper .
larson .
webster .
gump .

turn it off .
you are tuned to the american forces
vietnam network .
this is channel 6 , saigon .
good catch , gump .
you know how to play this ?
come on .
let me show you .
now , the secret to this game is no matter what happens , never , ever ... take your eye off the ball .
all right .
for some reason ,
ping pong came very natural to me .
see ?
any idiot can play .
so i started playing it all the time .
i played ping pong even when i didn' t have anyone to play ping pong with .
the hospital' s people said it made me look like a duck in water
whatever that means .
even lieutenant dan would come and watch me play .
i played ping pong so much ,
i even played it in my sleep .
now ... you listen to me .
we all have a destiny .
nothing just happens .
it' s all part of a plan !
i should have died out there with my men , but now ... l' m nothing but a god damn cripple , a legless freak !
look .
look !
look at me !
you see that ?
do you know what it' s like not to be able to use your legs ?
y y yes , sir , i do .
did you hear what i said ?
you cheated me !
i had a destiny .
i was supposed to die in the field with honor !
that was my destiny , and you ... cheated me out of it !
you understand what i' m saying , gump ?
this wasn' t supposed to happen
not to me .
i had a destiny .
i was ...
lieutenant ...
dan taylor .
y you still
lieutenant dan .
look at me .
what am i going to do now ?
what am i going to do now ?
pfc gump ?
yes , sir !

son , you been awarded the medal of honor .
guess what , lieutenant dan ?
they want to give me a med
ma' am .
what did they do with lieutenant dan ?
they sent him home .
two weeks later , i left vietnam .
the ceremony was kicked off with a can did speech by the presiden t regarding the need for further escalation of the war in vietnam .
johnson awarded 4 medals of honor to men from each of the armed services .
america owes you a debt of gratitude , son .
i understand you were wounded .
where were you hit ?
in the but tocks , sir .
well , that must be a sight .
i' d kinda like to see that .
# and here' s to you , mrs. robinson #
# jesus loves you more than you will know #
# whoa , whoa , whoa #
# god bless you , please , mrs. robinson ##
god damn , son !
after that , mama went to the hotel to lay down , so i went out for a walk to see our nation' s capital .
hi lary !
i got the vets .
what do you want to do with them ?
it' s a good thing mama was resting ,
' cause the streets was awful crowded with people
lookin' at all the statues and monuments , and some of them people were loud and pushy .
o. k. , follow me !
everywhere i went , i had to stand in line .
come on .
go !
hey , you' re a good man for doing this .
good .
o. k.
there was this man giving a little talk .
and for some reason , he was wearing an american flag for a shirt .
and he liked to say the " f " word ... a lot .
f " this and " f " that .
and every time he said the " f " word , people , for some reason , well , they cheered .
yeah !
yeah !
come on , man .
come up here , man .
come on .
come on .
yeah , you !
come on .
move , move !
go on .
let' s get up there .

well
there was only one thing i could say about the war in vietnam .
there' s only one thing i can say about ... the war in vietnam .
in vietnam ...

and that' s all i have to say about that .

jenny and me were just like peas and carrots again .
she showed me around and even in troduced me to some of her new friends .
shut that blind , man !
and get your white ass away from that window .
don' t you know we in a war here ?
don' t you know we in a war here ?
he' s cool .
he' s one of us .
let me tell you about us .
our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from the racial on slaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our black leaders , rape our women , and destroy our black communities .
who' s the baby killer ?
this is my good friend i told you about .
this is forrest gump .
forrest , this is wesley .
wesley and i lived together in berkeley , and he' s the president of the berkeley chapter ofsds .
we are here to offer protection and help for all those who need our help , because we , the black panthers , are against the war in vietnam .
we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them .
we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities .
we are against these racist and imperial acts
# and i gave her the gun #
# i shot her ##
forrest !
stop it !
stop it !
forrest !
stop it !

i shouldn' t have brought you here .
i should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle !
he should not be hitting you, jenny .
come on , forrest .
sorry i had a fight in the middle of your black panther party .
he doesn' t mean it when he does things like this .
i would never hurt you, jenny .
i know you wouldn' t , forrest .
i wanted to be your boy friend .
that uniform is a trip , forrest .
you look handsome in it .
you do .
you know what ?
what ?
i' m glad we were here together in our nation' s capital .
me , too , forrest .
we walked around all night , jenny and me , just talkin ' .
she told me about all the traveling she' d done and how she discovered ways to expand her mind and learn how to live in harmony ... which must be out west somewhere ,
' cause she made it all the way to california .
# love one another right now ##
hey .
anybody want to go to san francisco ?
i' il go .
far out !
it was a very special night for the two of us .
i didn' t want it to end .
wish you wouldn' t go, jenny .
i have to , forrest .
jenny ?
things got a little out of hand .
it' s just this war and that lying son of a bitch johnson and
i would never hurt you .
you know that .

i think ... you should go home to greenbow ,
alabama !
forrest , we have very different lives , you know .
i want you ... to have this .
forrest , i can' t keep this .
i got it ... just by doing what you told me to do .
why are you so good to me ?
you' re my girl .
i' il always be your girl .
# to everything , turn , turn , turn #
# there is a season , turn , turn , turn #
# and a time to every purpose #
# under heaven ##
and just like that , she was gone out of my life again .
that' s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind .
i thought i was going back to vietnam , but instead they decided the best way for me to fight the communists was to play ping pong , so i was in the special services , traveling around the country , cheering up wounded veterans and showing' em how to play ping pong .
i was so good that some years later , the army decided i should be on the all american ping pong team .
we were the first americans to visit the land of china in a million years or something .
somebody said world peace was in our hands , but all i did was play ping pong .
when i got home , i was a national celebrity , famouser even than captain kangaroo .
here he is , forrest gump .
right here .
gump , have a seat .
forrest gump , john lennon .
welcome home .
can you tell us , um , what was china like ?
in the land of china ... people hardly got nothin' at all .
no possessions ?
and in china , they never go to church .
no religion , too ?
oh .
hard to imagine .
well , it' s easy if you try , dick .
some years later , that nice young man from england was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some autographs .
for no particular reason at all ,
somebody shot him .
they gave you ... the congressional medal of honor .
now , that' s lieutenant dan .
lieutenant dan !
they gave you ... the congressional medal of honor .
yes , sir .
they surely did .
they gave you , an imbecile , a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself in front of the whole damn country , the congressional medal of honor .
yes , sir .
well ... that that' s just perfect !
yeah , well , i just got one thing to say to that
goddamn bless america .
hey , hey !
whoa
oh , god , whoa !
ow !
oh !
oh , god !
lieutenant dan !
lieutenant dan said he was living in a hotel and because he didn' t have no legs , he spent most of his time exercising his arms .
make a right .
take a right !
hey !
ah , ah !
what do you do here in new york , lieutenant dan ?
i' m living off the government tit .
hey , hey , hey , are you blind ?
i' m walking here !
ah , get out !
come on .
go , go , go !
i stayed with lieutenant dan and celebrated the holidays .
you have a great year , and hurry home .
god bless you .
have you found jesus yet , gump ?
i didn' t know i was supposed to be looking for him , sir .
that' s all these cripples down at the v. a.
that' s all they ever talk about .
jesus this and jesus that .
ha .
have i ... found jesus ?
they even had a priest come and talk to me .
he said god is listening , but i have to help myself .
now , if i accept jesus into my heart ,
i' il get to walk beside him in the kingdom of heaven .
did you hear what i said ?
walk ... beside him in the kingdom of heaven .
well ... kiss my crippled ass .
god is listening ?
what a crock ofshit .
i' m going to heaven , lieutenant dan .
oh ?
well ...
before you go ... why don' t you get your ass down to the corner and get us more ripple ?
yes , sir .
we' re at approximately 45th street in new york city at one astor plaza .
this is the site of the old
what the hell is in bayou la batre ?
shrimping boats .
shrimping boats ?
who gives a shit about shrimping boats ?
i got to buy me one soon as i have some money .
i promised bubba in vietnam that as soon as the war was over , we' d be partners .
he' d be the captain and i' d be his first mate .
but now that he' s dead , i got to be the captain .
a shrimp boat captain .
yes , sir .
a promise is a promise , lieutenant dan .
now hear this !
private gump here is gonna be a shrimp boat captain .
well , i tell you what , gilligan .
the day that you are a shrimp boat captain ,
i will come and be your first mate .

danny , what are you complaining about ?
danny , how you doing , huh ?
mr. hot wheels !
who' s your friend ?
my name is forrest .
forrest gump .
this is cunning carla and long limbs lenore .
so where you been , baby cakes , huh ?
haven' t seen you around lately .
you should have been here for christmas ,
' cause tommy bought a free round and gave everybody a turkey sandwich .
well , well , i had , uh ... company .
hey !
hey , we was just there !
that' s like times square .
don' t you just love new year' s ?
you can start all over .
everybody gets a second chance .
it' s funny ... but in the middle of all that fun ,
i began to think about jenny , wondering how she was spending her new year' s night out in california .
# don' t you love her ways ? #
# tell me what you say #
# don' t you love her madly ? #
# want to meet her daddy ? #
# don' t you love her face ? #
# don' t you love her as she' s walkin ' out the door ? ## 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 !
happy new year !
# should auld acquaintance be forgot #
# and never brought to mind #
happy new year , lieutenant dan !
# should auld acquaintance be forgot #
# ln days of auld lang syne ##
# together we stand #
# divided we fall #
# come on now , people , let' s #
# get on the ball #
# and work together #
# come on , come on #
# let' s work together ##
oh !
what are you , stupid or something ?
what' s your problem ?
what' s his problem ?
did you lose your packet in the war or something ?
is your friend stupid or something ?
what did you say ?
i said is your friend stupid or something ?
don' t call him stupid !
hey , don' t push her !
you shut up !
don' t you ever call him stupid !
come on , baby , why you being so upset , huh ?
get your goddamned clothes and get the hell out of here !
you should be in a sideshow .
you' re so pathetic !
get out of here !
you big guy !
loser .
you freak !
oh , no .
no .
i' m sorry i ruined your new year' s eve party , lieutenant dan .
she tastes like cigarettes .
i guess lieutenant dan figured there' s some things you just can' t change .
he didn' t want to be called crippled just like i didn' t want to be called stupid .
happy new year , gump .
the u. s. ping pong team met with president nixon today ...
wouldn' t you know it ?
a few months later , they invited me and the ping pong team to visit the white house .
so i went ... again .
and i met the president of the united states again .
only this time , they didn' t get us rooms in a real fancy hotel .
are you enjoying yourself in our nation' s capital , young man ? where are you staying ?
it' s called the hotel ebbott .
oh , no , no , no .
i know a much nicer hotel .
it' s brand new .
verymodern .
i' il have my people take care of it .
security .
yeah .
sir , you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way .
the lights are off and they must be looking for a fuse box ,
' cause them flashlights , they' re keeping me awake .
o. k. , sir .
i' il check it out .
thankyou .
good night .
therefore ...
i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow .
vice president ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office .
forrest gump .
yes , sir !
as you were .
i have your discharge papers .
service is up , son .
does this mean i can' t play ping pong no more ?
for the army , it does .
andjust like that , my service in the united states army was over .
so i went home .
i' m home , mama .
i know .
i know .
louise , he' s here .
now , when i got home , i had no idea , but mama had all sorts of visitors .
we' ve had all sorts of visitors .
everybody wants you to use their ping pong stuff .
one man even left a check for $25, 000 if you' d be agree able to saying you like using their paddle .
i only like using my own paddle .
hi , miss louise .
hey , forrest .
i know that , but it' s $25, 000 , forrest .
i thought maybe you could hold it for a while , see if it grows on you .
that mama , shesure was right .
it' s funny how things work out .
i didn' t stay home for long because i' d made apromise to bubba , and i always try to keep my promise , so i went on down to bayou la batre to meet bubba' s family .
are you crazy or just plain stupid ?
stupid is as stupid does , mrs. blue .
i guess .
and , of course ,
i paid my respect to bubba himself .
hey , bubba .
it' s me , forrest gump .
i remember everything you said , and i got it all figured out .
i' m taking $24, 562 . 47 that i got , that' s left after a new hair cut and a newsuit and to ok mama out to a real fancy dinner , and i bought a bus ticket , then three dr. peppers .
tell me something .
are you stupid or something ?
stupid is as stupid does , sir .
that' s what' s left after me saying ,
when i was in china on the all america ping pong team ,
i just loved playing ping pong with my flex o lite ping pong paddle , " which everybody knows isn' t true , but mama said it wasjust a little white lie , so it wasn' t hurting nobody .
so anyway , i' m putting all that on gas , ropes , and new nets and a brand new shrimping boat .
now bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping , but you know what i found out ?
shrimping is tough .
i only caught five .
a couple more , you can have yourself a cocktail .
hey , you ever think about naming this old boat ?
it' s bad luck to have a boat without a name .
i' d never named a boat before , but there was only one i could think of , the most beautiful name in the wide world .
# do a little dance #
# make a little love #
# get down tonight #
# get down tonight #
# do a little dance #
# make a little love #
# get down tonight #
# whoo #
# get down tonight ... ##
now , i hadn' t heard from jenny in a long while , but i thought about hera lot .
i hoped whatever she was doing made her happy .
# oh , and the bird you cannot change #
# and this bird you cannot change #
# lord knows i can' t change #
# lord , help me , i can' t change ##
i thought about jenny all the time .
hey !
lieutenant dan , what are you doing here ?
well , thought i' d try out my sea legs .
well , you ain' t got no legs , lieutenant dan .
yes , i know that .
you wrote me a letter , you idiot .
well , well .
captain forrest gump .
i had to see this for myself ... and ...
i told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain , that i' d be your first mate .
well , here i am .
i' m a man of my word .
o. k.
but don' t you be thinking that i' m going to be calling you " sir .
no , sir .
it' s my boat .
i have a feeling if we head due east , we' il find some shrimp , so take a left .
take a left !
which way ?
over there !
they' re over there !
get on the wheel and take a left .
o. k.
gump , what are you doing ?
take a left !
left !
that' s where we' re going to find those shrimp , my boy !
ha ha !
that' s where we' il find them .
still no shrimp , lieutenant dan .
o. k. , so i was wrong .
well , how are we going to find them ?
maybe you should just pray for shrimp .
# so pray that #
# i' m homeward bound ... ##
so i went to church every sunday .
sometimes lieutenant dan came , too , though i think he left the praying up to me .
no shrimp .
where the hell' s this god of yours ?
it' s funny lieutenant dan said that
' cause right then god showed up .
you' il never sink this boat !
now , me , i was scared , but lieutenant dan , he was mad .
come on !
you call this a storm ?
come on , you son of a bitch !
it' s time for a show down !
you and me !
i' m right here !
come and get me !
ha ha !
ha ha !
you' il never sink ... this ... boat !
ha ha ha ha !
hurricane carmen came through here yesterday , destroying nearly everything in its path .
and as in other towns up and down the coast ,
bayou la batre' s entire shrimping industry has fallen victim to carmen and has been left in utter ruin .
this reporter has learned , in fact , only one shrimping boat actually survived the storm .
louise .
louise , there' s forrest .
after that , shrimping was easy .
# there will be great bounty #
# oh , my god ... ##
since people still needed them shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barb ecues and all and we were the only boat left standing ,
bubba gump shrimp' s what they got .
we got a whole bunch of boats .
12 jennys , big old warehouse .
we even have hats that say " bubba gump " on them .
bubba gump shrimp .
it' s a household name .
hold on there , boy .
are you telling me you' re the owner of the bubba gump shrimp corporation ?
yes .
we got more money than davy crockett .
boy , i heard some whoppers in my time , but that tops them all .
ha ha ha ha !
we were sitting next to a millionaire .
well , i thought it was a very lovely story , and you tell it so well , with such enthusiasm .
would you like to see what lieutenant dan looks like ?
yes , i would .
that' s him right there .
let me tell you something about lieutenant dan .
forrest ...
i never thanked you for saving my life .
he neveractually said so , but i think he made his peace with god .
for the second time in 17 days ,
president ford escaped possible assassination today .
base to jenny 1 .
base to jenny 1 .
jenny 1 .
go , margo .
forrest has a phone call .
yeah , well , you' il have to tell them to call him back .
he is indisposed at the moment .
his mama' s sick .
where' s mama ?
she' s upstairs .
hi , forrest .
i' il see you tomorrow .
oh , all right .
sure got you straightened out , didn' t we , boy ?
what' s the matter , mama ?
i' m dying , forrest .
come on in , sit down over here .
why are you dying , mama ?
it' s my time .
it' s just my time .
oh , now ... don' t you be afraid , sweet heart .
death is just a part of life .
something we' re all destined to do .
i didn' t know it , but i was destined to be your mama .
i did the best i could .
you did good .
well ... l happen to believe you make your own destiny .
you have to do the best with what god gave you .
what' s my destiny , mama ?
you' re going to have to figure that out foryourself .
life is a box of chocolates , forrest .
you never know what you' re going to get .
mama always hada way of explaining things so i could understand them .
i will miss you , forrest .
she had got the cancer and died on a tuesday .
i bought her a new hat with little flowers on it .
and that' s all i have to say about that .
didn' t you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus ?
there' il be another one along shortly .
now , because i had been a football star and war hero and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain and a college graduate , the city fathers of greenbow , alabama , decided to get together and offered me a finejob .
so i never went back to work for lieutenant dan , though he did take care of my bubba gump money .
he got me invested in some kind of fruit company .
so then i got a call from him saying we don' t have to worry about money no more , and i said , " that' s good .
one less thing .
# i' ve got a new hope ... ##
now mama said there' s only so much fortune a man really needs , and the rest is just for showing off .
so i gave a whole bunch of it to the four square gospel church ... and i gave a whole bunch to the bayou la batre fishing hospital ... and even though bubba was dead and lieutenant dan said i was nuts ,
i gave bubba' s mama bubba' s share .
you know what ?
she didn' t have to work in nobody' s kitchen no more .
that smells wonderful .
and' cause i was a gozillionaire and lliked doing it so much ,
i cut that grass for free .
but at night time when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty ,
i' d always think of jenny .
and then ... she was there .
hello , forrest .
hello , jenny .
jenny came back and stayed with me .
maybe it was because she had no where else to go , or maybe it was because she was so tired
' cause she went to bed and slept and slept
like she hadn' t slept in years .
it was wonderful having her home .
every day we' d take a walk , and i' d jabber on like a monkey in a tree , and she' d listen about ping ponging and shrimping and mama making a trip up to heaven .
i did all the talking .
jenny most of the time was real quiet .
how could you do this ?
sometimes i guess there just aren' t enough rocks .
i never really knew why she came back , but i didn' t care .
it was like olden times .
we was like peas and carrots again .
every day , i' d pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her , and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get in the wide world .
they' re made just for running .
# carry me home to see my kin #
and she even showed me how to dance .
# i miss ol' bammy once again #
# and i think it' s a sin #
# sweet home alabama ... ##
well , we was like family , jenny and me ...
and it was the happiest time in my life .
you done watching it ?
mm hmm .
i' m going to bed .
will you marry me ?
i' d make a good husband , jenny .
you would , forrest .
but you won' t marry me .
you don' t want to marry me .
why don' t you love me, jenny ?
i' m not a smart man , but i know what love is .
jenny
forrest , i do love you .
where are you running offto ?
i' m not running .
that day , for no particular reason ,
i decided to go for a little run .
so i ran to the end of the road , and when i got there , i thought maybe i' d run to the end of town .
president carter , suffering from heat exhaustion
and when i got there ,
i thought maybe i' d just run across greenbow county .
now , i figured since i' d run this far , maybe i' d just run across the great state of alabama .
and that' s what i did .
i ran clear across alabama .
no particular reason .
i just kept on going .
i ran clear to the ocean .
and when i got there ,
i figured since i' d gone this far , might as well turn around , just keep on going .
and when i got to another ocean ,
i figured since i' d gone this far ...
i might as well just turn back and keep right on going . when i got tired , i slept . when i got hungry , i ate .
when i had to go ... you know ...
i went .
and so ... you just ran .
yeah .
# lookin ' out at the road rushin ' under my wheels #
# lookin ' back at the years gone by #
# like so many summer fields #
# ln' 65 , i was 17 #
# and runnin ' up one on one #
# i don' t know where i' m runnin ' now #
# i' m just runnin ' on #
# runnin ' on #
# runnin ' on empty #
# runnin ' on #
# runnin ' dry #
# runnin ' on ... ##
i' d think a lot ... about mama and bubba and lieutenant dan .
but most of all ,
i thought about jenny .
i thought about her a lot .
for more than two years , a man named forrest gump , a gardener from greenbow , alabama , stopping only to sleep , has been running across america .
charles cooper brings you this report .
for the fourth time on his journey across america ,
forrest gump , the gardener from greenbow , alabama , is about to cross the mississippi river again today .
i' il be damned .
forrest ?
sir , where are you running ?
are you doing this for world peace ?
are you doing this for the homeless ?
are you running for women' s rights ?
the environment ? they just couldn' t believe that somebody would do all that running for no particular reason .
why are you doing this ?
i just felt like running .
i just felt like runnin ' .
that' s you .
i can' t believe it' s really you .
now ... for some reason , what i was doing seemed to ... make sense to people .
it was like an alarm went off in my head .
i said , " here' s a guy that' s got his act together .
here' s somebody who has the answer .
i' il follow you anywhere , mr. gump .
so i got company .
and after that , i got more company .
and then , even more people joined in .
somebody later told me it gave people hope .
now
now , i don' t know anything about that , but some of those people asked me if i could help them out .
i was wondering if you might help me .
i' m in the bumper sticker business .
i need a good slogan , and since you' ve been so inspirational ,
i thought you might be able to help me
whoa , man !
you just ran through a big pile of dog shit !
it happens .
what , shit ?
sometimes .
and someyears later , i heard that that fella did come up with a bumper sticker slogan and made a lot of money off of it .
another time , i was running along .
somebody who' d lost all his money in the t shirt business , he wanted toput my face on a t shirt , but he couldn' t draw that well , and he didn' t have a camera .
here , use this one .
nobody likes that color anyway .
have a nice day .
someyears later , i found out that that man did come up with an idea for a t shirt .
he made a lot of money .
anyway , like i was saying ,
i had a lot of company .
my mama always said ,
you got to put the past behind you before you can move on .
and i think that' s what my running was all about .
i had run for three years ... two months .... 14days , and 16 hours .
quiet .
quiet .
he' s going to say something .
i' m pretty tired .
think i' il go home now .
now what are we supposed to do ?
and just like that ... my runnin ' days was over .
so i went home to alabama .
moments ago , at 2 . : 25 p. m. , as president reagan was leaving the
five or six gunshots were fired by an unknown , would be assassin .
the president was shot in the chest
i picked up the mail .
and one day , out of the blue clear sky ,
i got a letter from jenny wondering if i could come down to savannah and see her , and that' s what i' m doing here .
uh huh .
she saw me on tv ... running .
i' m supposed to go on the number 9 bus to richmond street and get offand go one block left to 1947 henry street ... apartment 4 .
why , you don' t need to take a bus .
henry street is just five or six blocks ... down that way .
down that way ?

i hope everything works out for you !

long enough for the stars to come out ...
and th en it was nice .
it was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou . there was always a million sparkles on the water ...
like that mountain lake .
it was so clear , jenny , it looked like there were two skies one on top of the other .
and then in the desert , when the sun comes up ...
i couldn' t tell where heaven stopped and the earth began .
it' s so beautiful .
i wish i could' ve been there with you .
you were .
i love you .
you died on a saturday morning .
and i had you placed here under our tree .
and i had that house of your father ' s bulldozed to the ground .
