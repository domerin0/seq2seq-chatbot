left hook .
once is not enough .
come on , again .
jab , jab .
that' s it .
you see what happens when you listen to me ?
way to go .
thanks .
hey , you do not belong up here , all right ?
i' m not gonna tell you again .
go wash your hands and make yourself invisible .
pete , she' s your daughter .
she wants to help out .
she' s a midget with a head full of stupid .
who' s she gonna help , huh ?
crisco , can i get a hand over here ?
yeah .
on the way , mr. k.
come on !
hey , do you know who you are out of all the girls in the world ?
i' m your favorite ?
and what' s she gonna do when she grows up ?
kick butt and break hearts .
that' s right .
the world' s an oyster and you' re a pearl .
pearls are pretty , and they' re tough .
and pretty tough can do anything .
remember that .
ok , uncle ray .
ok .
hey , mr. abel .
hey , how are you , sir ?
good to see you .
good morning , mr. abel .
yeah , beautiful .
coffee .
where' s my coffee ?
coffee .
it was not a question the first time i asked for it .
you told me last week , " absolutely , positively no coffee " , and i absolutely , positively believed you .
tear sheets for tomorrow .
the telegram bled our ad .
it' s nothing major , but we should get credit for the next fight .
the budget is officially overdue .
i ran some numbers ...
did you take care of my bookie ?
i stalled him and your ex wife .
i also printed out your e mail , restocked your bar , hosed down mel harris .
top drawer , left side , all you have to do is sign off on them .
you see , that' s why i' m the boss , kallen .
because i let you handle things for me .
nobody gives me credit , but if i were you and worked for me ,
i would send myself roses .
well , roses die and you might be allergic , but thanks for thinking of you .
larocca' s event briefing , where do you want that ?
in the conference room .
and don' t stick the cutout in the corner .
it' s my handiwork .
put it someplace sammy can see .
all right ?
i hate it .
i hate it a lot .
are these guys gonna fight or foxtrot ?
they look like homo sapiens or something .
they are homo sapiens ,
kallen speaks .
and from a mile away .
am i contagious or something ?
no , it' s not a hygienic thing .
she just gets kind of shy around you .
i' m sorry you' re unhappy with the standee , but we only went with the shot because your guys approved it .
if i say the shit' s shit , it' s shit .
i mean , they told me that you signed off on it , sammy .
i don' t know what the hell happened .
jackie , what happened ?
i don' t care what happened .
you have 48 hours before the fight .
i want the two faggots fixed .
i mean , who the hell does sam larocca think he is ?
a made man , that' s who .
no , he is the antichrist .
he is ...
with a bank account .
he is this .
an $80 shoe ?
he is the gum on the bottom of my shoe .
that' s what abel and larocca are .
they' re the gum , you' re the shoe .
how come they walk all over you ?
get a little older , work a little longer , you won' t be so judgmental then .
you think i like working for idiots who take advantage of me ?
that' s easy for you to say .
this is not the best job you ever had .
at least here i get to see boxing , in person , for free .
boxing makes all the other shit bearable .
if i didn' t love it as much as i do ,
i' d be the first in line to bend over so larocca and abel could kiss my ass .
ok , don' t get upset with me just because you know that i know how smart you are .
so now you think smart is all there is to it ?
that your brain can just plot the best course and your life just goes there ?
the world is not an oyster .
it is a smelly tank full of dirty water and sharks .
it is not that easy to swim .
jackie , you need to get real about where you are , which is stuck .
in the basement .
you can' t even see the glass ceiling from here .
find an elevator , press some buttons .
at least the only way out is up .
yo , tyrell , wait up !
clean towels , we need more clean towels .
bad break , rex .
bad break ?
i won that fight .
come on , you saw it .
everybody saw it .
you would' ve won if you hadn' t run out of gas .
you train serious , you could have a career .
i would' ve given you a draw .
you deserved a draw .
he looks like shit .
day old shit .
if day old shit shook like an ak 47 .
shut up !
you can' t say dick that wouldn' t piss me off more .
it' s all good .
mr. larocca , it' s adrenaline .
shakes don' t mean nothing .
ask my last 12 wins .
hey , jackie .
hey , devon .
i' m only interested in the 13th .
lose tonight and you' il be waving bye bye to your career , your fan club and the free hoochie mamas that go with it .
what are you selling ?
sorry to interrupt , but it' s showtime .
let' s get out of here .
come on , you can do this .
let' s do this .
get your hands up , you bum !
he' s got no left hand .
what' s going on ?
what' s the story with greene ?
pedro !
pedro !
pedro !
pedro !
pedro !
get off the ropes !
ok , ok .
that' s it .
that' s it .
forget this guy greene .
yeah .
no more , no more .
he' s dead .
that' s a kaput .
no , he' s good .
it' s like he didn' t bother to show up .
trust me , he' s dead .
and if i know sammy , he already wrote the obituary .
see you , gavin .
see you .
excuse me .
yeah .
jacqueline .
i' d offer a seat , but i don' t think anyone would get up .
thirsty ?
let me buy you a drink .
bowie , hi .
can i get a wine cooler and whatever gavin' s drinking whenever he' s ready ?
on me .
all right .
like that dress .
the cleaner' s shrunk it .
i' il send a thank you note .
did you get that fax on needles ' demos ?
they' re good .
put him on your show .
he' s exactly what your advertisers want .
do we have to do this now ?
do what , talk ?
we' re not talking .
you' re negotiating .
stop it .
listen , if i was a man trying to close a deal , you wouldn' t say that .
oh , please .
don' t throw sex in my face .
unless you mean it .
you see how you are ?
i can' t have a regular conversation with you .
you' re afraid to have a regular conversation with me .
oh , right .
you' re mr. irresistible .
i wish .
kallen !
come here .
come here !
i gotta go .
there it is .
for the pride of puerto rico .
promise me you' il wear this for the championship bout .
promise me you' il wear this for the championship bout .
here we go .
oh , yeah !
kallen .
good .
j. lo' s coming to the coliseum next month .
i want me and pedro front and center .
front and center ?
consider it done .
done and done .
hey , shouldn' t you have that on ice ?
what are you , a doctor ?
no , the doctors are busy stitching up greene .
unprofessional pussy didn' t even bother to give the fans a decent fight , nothing .
screw him .
he' s a polaroid .
he' s out of the picture .
pedro , i' m a man who hates defeat , but i' m not too proud to be candid .
you won because you worked and greene didn' t .
he' s a lazy ass fighter , and lazy ass always loses .
that' s a fact .
right , half pint ?
well , i' m ...
i' m not sure why devon lost .
maybe he just felt insecure about his corner .
you know , boxing is a team sport .
if a boxer doesn' t feel support in his corner , sometimes it comes out in the ring .
listen to the barbie doll with the glass balls .
what do you know about support ?
what do you know about boxing ?
executive assistant .
you wipe lrv abel' s ass for a living .
i cover lrv abel' s ass for a living .
and i know as much about boxing as either of you .
what' s that mean ?
nothing .
forget it .
forget it ?
you talk like you think you can do what i do .
what' s the point in thinking that ?
i don' t have a boxer .
do you think you can do what i do ?
possibly , if given a chance .
a chance ?
that' s all you need ?
yeah , probably .
greene' s contract .
it' s yours .
sure it is .
hey !
you don' t want it ?
i can' t afford it .
you can' t afford it .
i' il make it easy .
it' s yours for a dollar .
i don' t have a dollar .
i' il lend you a dollar .
i tell you what , half pint .
i' m gonna forget what you said since you don' t know what you' re talking about .
because if you did , you' d know it don' t pay to shoot your mouth off at me .
i just bought a boxer for a buck .
i think it pays pretty well , sam .
i' m not keeping him .
i' m not keeping greene .
it was a thing that became a thing .
larocca insulted me .
so what ?
sammy insults everybody .
you' re gonna call him , make up , kiss his ass if you have to .
if anybody asks about greene , it was a joke , a little parlor trick that you and sammy played .
you lost your temper , you said a few ridiculous things .
you set it right .
it' il blow over .
sammy won' t think you' re trying to grow a brain on me .
it wasn' t ridiculous , what i said .
and you shouldn' t be drinking that coffee .
welcome back to the live weekend edition of the reese report ,
fight fan or feminist , you' re going to love this story ,
after watching devon greene crawl off the canvas , fight promoter sam larocca managed to lose his boxer and his ego in a round of verbal sparring with coliseum employee jackie kallen ,
larocca thought he had kallen in the corner , but she outmaneuvered him and wound up walking away with greene' s contract ,
the price tag ?
a dollar ,
that' s platinum stuff ,
you couldn' t write a check big enough for the look on larocca' s face ,
it was priceless , and i enjoyed it for free ,
renee , it' s me .
quick .
turn on channel 28 .
i' m on tv !
hey , sam , do you know what a coup d' etat is ?
look it up ,
i' m gavin reese for the reese report , see you next week ,
girl , what the hell happened to all his money ?
i didn' t have a chance to ask .
his phone' s disconnected , so i had to come .
i got here , i was fine , and then i wasn' t fine .
so you called me for blackup .
like i need gangster lncorporated in my life .
like larocca is gonna let you waltz off with his boxer .
like any of this makes any sense .
last night , after i vomited and ruled out suicide , i realized
i' m more scared not to do this than to do it .
devon is a ranked boxer .
god practically dropped him in my lap .
how can i walk away ?
i might as well spit in the face of destiny .
now he' s your destiny ?
devon , are you in there ?
it' s jackie kallen .
we tried .
we failed .
let' s go .
wait , wait , i hear something .
he' s unlocking the door .
he' s home .
devon , did you know your phone' s not work ... ?
you know stormy .
this ain' t no double date .
get the shit .
we don' t have any shit .
then why' d you page me ?
we didn' t .
why ?
devon , it' s me .
it' s jackie from the arena .
we just ...
anyway , we came by to say hey .
and you' re busy , so we' il come back .
you bitches ain' t going nowhere till we get our rock !
give my man your bag !
there' s just enough tokens in there for my laundry .
that' s all i have with me ...
a dollar bill , maybe .
what am i , a punk ?
a chump ?
you can just smoke t. j. ' s shit like it' s a gift ?
man , come here !
man , you done messed up my high .
come on , jackie , let' s go !
let' s go !
let' s go !
let' s go !
i' m sorry .
i don' t forgive you .
where' s my rock , bitches ?
what about that guy , the way he waxed the floor with both their asses ?
that was off the hook !
honey , no .
he was a thug who out thugged another thug .
a thug and a half if you count your boy devon , who is pathetic , jackie !
his contract only cost a dollar .
you still overpaid !
call me later .
i' m sorry .
you better be .
i' m going to see my cousin malik .
i don' t know why you mess with me , all these criminals out here , man .
oh , hey , luther shaw .
jackie kallen .
i bailed you out .
i know you ?
no , no .
not exactly .
listen .
do you have a minute for a cup of coffee , a beer ?
how about a milk shake ?
a milk shake ?
yeah .
yeah , whatever you drink .
listen , i know this is unusual .
believe me , i don' t make a habit of bailing strangers out of jail .
that would make me a nut , a broke nut .
and i' m not .
i' m not nutty .
i' m just a person taking a chance .
you might be interested in who i am and what i have to say .
if you' re not , i totally understand .
you don' t owe me a thing .
if , on the other hand , you are , my car' s parked around the corner .
i' m harmless .
really .
really , the worst i could give you is a ride .
it was brutal , you know , it was beautiful the way you fought .
yeah .
i can tell you fought before .
you boxed .
you had some training , you won some amateur bouts .
you were good ...
do you always talk like this ?
like what ?
too much ?
actually , people have said ...
that' s a yes .
know what , pull over right here .
right here .
pull over right here .
ok , luther .
this shit you' re talking is crazy .
i think you' re crazy .
you gotta be .
hanging with crackhead devon .
i wasn' t hanging with him .
i came to see ...
look , i didn' t know he was doing crack , ok ?
it' s sad .
another black man bites the dust .
thanks for the bail , bitch .
jackie !
what' s up ?
my name is jackie !
crazy broad .
what' s happening ?
now , luth , we ain' t saying that you ain' t bad .
we know that , but don' t be selling us some bullshit , because you know you ain' t mopped the floor with no devon greene .
i' m telling you , man , i gave that fool an old fashioned , project ass whupping .
i' m telling you , his partner tried to get brave and sneak me .
i had to dust his ass off too .
you still here ?
yeah .
go home .
i can' t .
you didn' t let me finish .
following him and shit .
what' s up with that ?
a little uptown piece .
i know .
it must seem a little out there .
all right , way out there .
but that is where all the good stuff is , luther .
like talent , and you ... ... you' re talented .
so this chance you call yourself taking , why you taking it on me ?
because i' ve been around boxing my whole life .
i know it like the back of my hand .
i know potential , and i see it in you .
i do , luther .
i got potential ?
yeah .
watch out , world .
don' t laugh at me .
all right ?
i' m serious .
if you took me serious , we could be driving jags and sporting versace .
you' re a woman .
and you' re white .
say it like i' m a disease .
in the fight game , you are .
say it like i' m a disease .
in the fight game , you are .
i' m not saying it would be easy .
all right ?
but i' m used to hard .
i am .
ok ?
how do you want to do this ?
do you want to work together ?
you want to make a deal ?
make a deal ?
yeah .
you never managed nobody in your whole life .
how you gonna front me , you can' t front yourself ?
you' re nine to fiving it .
you' re driving a damn honda .
i have some savings , i' il do a budget .
i' m good with budgets .
and i' m really good with people .
i can read them .
and i can read you , luther , and i know you want to do this .
maybe i' m interested .
maybe i' il call you .
maybe i won' t .
you' re the one that' s gonna have to wait and see .
when you pay your tickets , you can register your vehicle .
basically , it' s what you call an " all there is to it " situation .
mister , when you pay your tickets , you can register ...
hey , felix .
next !
jackie kallen .
we spoke on the phone .
i remembered you , you didn' t remember me .
remember ?
hey , cynthia , i' m breaking .
so you say this boy is good , huh ?
well , good is a dime a dozen .
oh , no , he' s better than good .
he' s the bomb .
and you' re the best .
you' ve turned more chumps into champs than eddie futch .
i got out of the game for a reason , you know .
yeah , i know you had a stroke in ' 96 .
i was sorry to hear about that .
the stroke didn' t do nothing but clear my head .
look , i ain' t got time to waste training no cash registers in it for the money .
that' s a wonderful sentiment , and i totally agree .
although ultimately , boxing is a business .
it' s a sport first .
you know , learn your craft , pay your dues .
money will come , and it will go .
that' s why they call it " cash flow " .
felix , this kid reminds me of marvin hagler .
it' s just nonstop punches .
he is the real deal .
i wouldn' t have troubled you otherwise .
ray ray kallen' s niece .
all right .
i' il take a meet .
felix .
luther may just ...
he may be just a ... tiny bit raw .
well , raw' s workable .
rotten isn' t .
look , felix , i don' t know what to tell you .
hey , felix , it' s traffic , it' s rush hour .
yes .
this time every day .
hey , luther !
there he is .
felix reynolds .
this tired ass old man is gonna be my trainer .
lady , i thought you said you had a plan .
let me see your stance .
he ain' t worth it .
oh , well .
next .
next ?
hey , do you see a line anywhere ?
you stop being a brat and apologize .
a brat ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
whatever it takes to get him back .
he is it .
hey , felix !
now , luther has something to say to you .
luther .
hey .
look , old man , hold up .
no disrespect intended , but what have you done ?
who have you trained ?
let' s hear some actual ring experience .
you first .
was i right or what ?
yeah , he packs a helluva punch like you said .
combinations need tightening .
they' re all over .
but he' s strong , got a great feint , and he' s a southpaw like hagler .
he could make some noise in the middleweight division .
all right .
time , boys .
well , if he can learn to be a switch hitter , fight from the right hand stance as well as the left ,
he could surprise some people .
left , right , whatever .
it was all right ?
it was better than all right .
but you gotta get in shape , you gotta get in boxing shape , right ?
yeah , your body' s strong .
your mind ... ... gonna need a whole lot of discipline .
ain' t nothing wrong with my mind .
the ring .
get it at 5 : 00 .
oh , no , i don' t get off of work till 6 .
in the morning .
is it cheaper ?
no .
it' s available .
five o' clock in the morning ?
man , you can forget that .
you gotta leave some room for sleep .
haven' t you slept enough , son ?
in three years , i pay you 2 ...
luther ?
listen .
three years , 250 a week , then i recoup that amount from your winnings .
after that , after we start making a profit , you take the lion' s share , i get 33 and a third .
what you think , felix ?
you heard what the lawyer said .
she' s assuming all the risks .
she' s making an investment in you .
well , she ain' t got to worry .
you bring it all on .
i' m gonna squash whatever you send my way .
lady , that' s the best i can do .
a grand for all that gold ?
are you nuts ?
it' s worth three times more than that .
worth ain' t the way it works .
what about fair ?
does fair work ?
no ?
ok .
ok , what about this ?
you give me 1, 250 , i throw that in for free .
1, 250 .
please don' t screw me beyond that point .
i have kids .
how are you doing ?
how the hell you been ?
how you been ?
hey , luth , look here .
this here is kevin keyes , the best cutman in the business .
good to meet you .
how you doing ?
this is cedric mouketendi , your sparring partner .
mouke what ?
mouketendi .
it' s ugandan .
call me rick .
it' s easier .
i' m gonna take you out , africa .
monkey' s ass always talks shit .
off the ropes !
off the ropes !
come on , spin out of there , now !
time !
time .
time .
now you see what the hell i' m telling you about your jab ?
stop street fighting .
when he misses , counterpunch him .
his rhythm' s great .
it ain' t his rhythm i' m worried about .
in a minute , when i say again .
i put him in with a bigger man so he' d learn how to move .
hey !
hey !
hey !
luther !
luther !
hey !
come on !
come on , now .
come on .
boy , you wanna fight like a damn hoodlum ?
i' il toss your black ass back out on the street !
you think i' m playing with you ?
i ain' t playing with you , boy !
hey , luther , look at me .
look , look .
you can' t win if you fight dirty , do you understand that ?
you all right , son ?
yeah , i' m all right .
he' s here to help you .
sorry , it won' t happen again .
will it ?
won' t happen again .
say it like we can hear it !
it won' t happen again !
hey .
hey .
i don' t want any threatening or yelling .
that is not helping him .
yeah , well , i' m trying to teach the boy how not to use his fists .
what do you suggest ?
handcuffs ?
whatever happened to this dude ?
your uncle ray ray .
he died about a year after that was taken .
hey , i' il start a scrapbook for you as soon as we get our first fight .
so did your dad start you in boxing ?
no .
counselor , juvenile hall .
in your lap .
and your dad ?
may he rest in peace .
and your mom ?
who the hell knows , man ?
do you have any brothers and sisters ?
i got a brother named michael in philly .
he' s a year older .
stupid ass social services .
they separated us , so we grew up apart .
i see him when i see him .
it' s no big deal .
i thought we were gonna be straight .
i' m being straight with you .
who were you beating up today in the gym ?
it wasn' t mouketendi .
i lost my temper .
you found your temper .
what you lost is the rest of you .
look , i go off sometimes , all right ?
it' s just how i am .
it' s not a problem .
yeah ?
the problem you don' t have already got in your way , and you haven' t thrown a punch in a pro fight .
i mean , don' t you wanna win , luther ?
i do .
i wanna win .
you know , you got all these expectations .
what are you gonna do if this don' t work out ?
it' il work out , luther .
you just have to let yourself trust me .
i am not the enemy .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
hold up , old man , i ain' t into no s & m stuff .
who do you think you is ?
marvelous marvin hagler , sugar ray robinson ?
you another young wannabe fighter , come a dime a dozen , trying to look pretty .
start with the basics .
i' il tie down your right arm so you can learn to throw a left .
you gotta learn to be balanced on both sides .
fight somebody that know how to handle a southpaw , better be ready to show him something different .
now snap out that jab .
let me see it .
5 : 00' s the best i can do .
i need your locker dues .
ok , coach .
come get it .
you know there' s a powder for that .
six thirty is open .
i want a 6 : 30 .
yeah , and i want a blowjob every hour on the hour .
is that why you' re acting like such a dick ?
all right , dig it in , that' s right , dig it in .
now jab him out .
jab him .
to the body , to the body , to the body .
combination .
all right , push him off , push him off , push off .
jump right back on him .
now , kallen and this amateur monkey she scraped off the street , shaw , you said they were nothing .
that ain' t what i hear .
it was , sam .
he' s been training with reynolds .
he' s been kicking the shit out of some guys in the gym .
that bitch does not find a fight in this town , or nowhere near it .
ever .
make it understood .
anybody puts kallen' s boy on a card puts his own ass out of business .
shaw .
luther shaw .
s h a w.
just because you never heard of him , he can' t be phenomenal ?
no , you can' t call me back .
no , it' s his manager .
yeah , i' m a woman .
no .
i haven' t thought about strapping one on , mister .
have you ?
well , i think you have a really nice voice too .
i do .
but i can' t cash those compliments at a bank .
i don' t need a date .
what i really need is a fight for my boxer .
jackie kallen for crisco cohen .
no , he does know who i am .
did you hear me ?
i' ve known him since we were kids ,
how many times do i have to say this ?
are you listening ?
now put your hands together and give a warm buffalo welcome
all right , baby . to our trio of precious gems ,
ruby , emerald and sapphire ,
all that plastic .
it' s a wonder she doesn' t melt in that spotlight .
crisco , it' s me , jackie kallen .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i got a boxer .
you drove 200 miles to tell me that ?
you couldn' t pick up the phone ?
i did .
four times .
hey , i' m a businessman .
yours ain' t the only number i gotta call .
how' s judy ?
i have never cheated on her .
i just come to these joints for relaxation .
i remember that , crisco .
how do you think i found you ?
it took me a while , but i found you .
yeah , well ...
great .
what are you ... ?
well ...
you got a boxer ?
good luck .
100 men ahead of you manage for a living .
i never even heard of your guy .
luther shaw .
put him on an undercard .
see what he can do .
hey .
we' il never get a fight in the midwest as long as sam larocca lives and breathes .
too bad .
i can' t believe you have the nerve to shirk me off .
my father taught you everything you' il ever know .
pete kallen is the only reason you are where you are today .
pete would spin in his grave if he could see what you' re doing .
look , stick to what you know .
you' re a secretary , for chrissake .
and you' re a married man addicted to strip joints and god knows what else .
i am sure i could find out .

yeah , uuf .
uuf ?
what the hell is that ?
ulterior uterine fibrosis .
oh , uuf .
it' s a venereal disease .
no .
it' s a female disease .
there' s nothing venereal about it .
it' s still difficult to discuss .
yeah , privates are tough to talk about .
most women would' ve made something up .
i' il probably only need a few days sick leave because the procedure i' m having , it' s really just minor surgery .
that' s good .
where is the operation ?
i' il probably just have it in my doctor' s office downtown .
well , that' s a little out of the way , isn' t it ?
unless you mean downtown buffalo .
how long am i in this business ?
long enough .
nothing goes behind my back .
what did you think ?
it wouldn' t get back to me ?
well , how can i think ?
i don' t have a brain .
you also don' t have a job now unless you stop with this silly extracurricular bullshit .
now , you will stop , or i' il fire your ass .
and you' il lose your pension , your benefits , everything i let you work for .
trust me , kallen , you don' t want this kind of kaput .
i' d rather have that kind of kaput than your kind of stupid .
and remember , use your jab .
nervous ?
why i gotta be nervous ?
that' s good .
you' re nervous .
use the energy , luther .
this guy' s all that stands in your way of the next guy .

here it is .
hey , wait a minute .
what are you doing ?
you talk to me .
he boxes .
i book .
yeah .
we need local exposure .
you need an a plus story .
i' m handing you one , exclusively .
it' s not algebra , gavin .
jackie , you against larocca makes a great , quaint anecdote .
don' t make a mission out of it .
so , what , you' re trying so hard not to say is that it' s a man' s world ?
i don' t have to say it .
you know it .
you have a love for the sport ...
but i should worship from afar .
god forbid i use anything from the neck up .
he has to win a few more fights .
he has to climb up the card before i hot dog him .
one more fight .
what' s your rush ?
well , i got fired .
or maybe i quit .
as if you didn' t know .
the point is , i can' t wait for you to decide if luther is newsworthy .
he is .
luther shaw weighs in at ... ... 159 pounds on the dot .
here you go .
they get on the scale thirsty .
they get off even thirstier .
he' s heavier since buffalo .
yeah , he' s stronger .
your guy looks pretty good too .
thank you so much .
don' t drink that .
don' t even smell it .
i' m serious .
i' il get you another one .
hey there , mathias .
hi .
listen , i saw your last fight , and wow .
that was one beautiful left hook .
oh .
oh , oh , sorry .
oh , thanks .
i just wanted to say may the best man win .
no hard feelings , no matter what happens .
no .
stay back .
he don' t like it down there .
he don' t like it down there .
nice jab .
good jab .
luther , go back to the body .
jump on him , that' s right .
get up on him .
hit him hard .
beautiful jab .
break clean .
come on .
you ok , mathias ?
he don' t wanna fight no more ?
turn around and box .
can you continue , mathias ?
do you want to box ?
all right .
it' s over .
way to go to the body , huh ?
that felt good .
that' s the way to work downtown .
what happened ?
easy , take it easy , easy .
get them off .
get them off !
oh , kid .
thanks .
ok , well , that' s my job ... ... to see shit coming .
break it up .
neutral corner .
four or five more miles .
come on , grab my hand .
if you grab my hand , i' m going to bring you up the hill .
come on , keep turning .
get on the inside and turn .
get back .
one ...
sounds like things are going great .
oh , better than great .
terrific .
it' s over .
no .
no ?
why ?
all right , no elevator , but the rooms are huge .
electric' s included .
the fireplace burns real wood .
open this thing on the top before you light a fire .
it' s called a flue .
don' t ask me why .
what do you think ?
tell you , the place is tight .
i think i like it .
you know , i hope i can afford it .
it' s all about balancing your checkbook .
did you fill out those bank applications i gave you ?
oh , i don' t know .
i don' t even remember what i did with those .
this is the lease agreement for you to look over .
it' s the usual , first and last .
and i got you an extension on your tax returns , but get it in next week .
envelopes , stamps , stationery , all in here .
so how come you don' t have any kids ?
it just never came up , the opportunity .
it could still , later .
i guess .
i think that you would be dope as a mom .
oh , thanks .
luther , i think you' re going to want to get renter' s insurance .
yeah .
yeah , sure .
listen , jackie ...
man , this is embarrassing to admit , but , you know , guys like me ...
i don' t know nothing about tax forms and lease agreements , insurance or whatever .
hell , man , i never even voted .
in my former line of business , i dealt with cash .
it' s either cash on the barrel , or i' m gonna hit you with the barrel .
you know , balancing a checkbook ...
forget about it .
luther , you don' t need to be ashamed or embarrassed about anything , ok ?
all kinds of people don' t know all kinds of shit .
i can really help you with this stuff .
we could fill those forms out togeth ...
what was that for ?
for everything .
we' re the new kids on the block , we expect to be picked on , but we don' t run from anybody .
i can' t say the same for some people .
by " some people " , do you mean the newly crowned
middleweight world champion pedro hernandez ?
hernandez claims he' s hungry for a worthy opponent .
everybody knows luther' s that guy .
i mean , what , to him , luther' s the invisible man ?
oh , but i guess it' s hard to see someone when you' re running away from him , especially if you' re running scared .
now , pedro hernandez won the middleweight crown in devastating fashion against a great ex champ .
luther , with only 14 fights , do you think you can beat him ?
i can , i could , and i most definitely would .
i' d probably knock him out if he didn' t faint first , pedro .
well , there' s only one way to see how this cliffhanger will end .
stay tuned to channel 28 .
don' t miss what you can see here with me .
exclusively .
you' re our local guy .
as for pedro hernandez , if you' re watching ,
