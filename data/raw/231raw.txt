dagol !
dagol ?
dagol .
give us that , dagol , my love .
why ?
because . . . . . . it' s my birthday and i wants it .
my precious .
they cursed us .
murderer .
murderer " they called us .
they cursed us and drove us away .
gollum .
gollum .
gollum .
and we wept , precious .
we wept to be so alone .
and cool so nice for feet
and we only wish to catch a fish
so juicy sweet
and we forgot the taste of bread . . . . . . the sound of trees . . . . . . the softness of the wind .
we even forgot our own name .
my precious .
wake up !
wake up !
wake up , sleepies .
we must go , yes .
we must go at once .
haven' t you had any sleep , mr. frodo ?
i' ve gone and had too much .
must be getting late .
no .
it isn' t .
it isn' t midday yet .
the days are growing darker .
come on !
must go !
no time !
not before mr. frodo' s had something to eat .
no time to lose , silly .
here .
what about you ?
oh , no , i' m not hungry .
leastways , not for lembas bread .
sam .
all right .
we don' t have that much left .
we have to be careful or we' re going to run out .
you go ahead and eat that , mr. frodo .
i' ve rationed it .
there should be enough .
for what ?
the journey home .
come , hobbitses .
very close now .
very close to mordor .
no safe places here .
hurry .
i feel like i' m back at the green dragon . . . . . . after a hard day' s work .
only , you' ve never done a hard day' s work .
welcome , my lords . . . . . . to lsengard !
you young rascals !
a merry hunt you' ve led us on . . . . . . and now we find you feasting and . . . and smoking !
we are sitting on a field of victory . . . . . . enjoying a few well earned comforts .
the salted pork is particularly good .
salted pork ?
hobbits .
we' re under orders from treebeard . . . . . . who' s taken over management of lsengard .
young master gandalf .
i' m glad you' ve come .
wood and water , stock and stone i can master .
but there is a wizard to manage here . . . . . . locked in his tower .
and there saruman must remain under your guard , treebeard .
well , let' s just have his head and be done with it .
no .
he has no power anymore .
the filth of saruman . . . . . . is washing away .
trees will come back to live here .
young trees .
wild trees .
pippin !
bless my bark !
peregrin took !
i' il take that , my lad .
quickly , now .
tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country .
hail the victorious dead .
hail !
i am happy for you .
he is an honorable man .
you are both honorable men .
it was not thoden of rohan who led our people to victory .
don' t listen to me .
you are young .
and tonight is for you .
oh , you can search far and wide you can drink the whole town dry
but you' il never find a beer so brown but you' il never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our hometown as the one we drink in our hometown
you can drink your fancy ales you can drink ' em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true
comes from the green dragon
thank you !
i win !
no news of frodo ?
no word .
nothing .
we have time .
every day , frodo moves closer to mordor .
do we know that ?
what does your heart tell you ?
that frodo is alive .
yes .
yes , he' s alive .
too risky .
too risky .
thieves .
they stole it from us .
kill them .
kill them .
kill them both .
quiet !
mustn' t wake them .
mustn' t ruin it now .
but they knows .
they knows .
they suspects us .
what' s it saying , my precious , my love ?
ls smagol losing his nerve ?
no .
not .
never .
smagol hates nasty hobbitses .
smagol wants to see them dead .
and we will .
smagol did it once .
he can do it again .
it' s ours !
ours !
we must get the precious .
we must get it back .
patience !
patience , my love .
first we must lead them to her .
we lead them to the winding stair .
yes , the stairs .
and then ?
up , up , up , up , up the stairs we go . . . . . . until we come to the tunnel .
and when they go in . . . . . . there' s no coming out .
she' s always hungry .
she always needs to feed .
she must eat .
all she gets is filthy orcses .
and they doesn' t taste very nice , does they , precious ?
no .
not very nice at all , my love .
she hungers for sweeter meats .
hobbit meat .
and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes . . . . . . then we will find it .
and take it for me !
for us .
yes .
we meant " for us .
gollum .
gollum .
the precious will be ours . . . . . . once the hobbitses are dead !
you treacherous little toad !
no !
no !
master !
no , sam !
leave him alone !
i heard it from his own mouth .
he means to murder us .
never !
smagol wouldn' t hurt a fly .
he' s a horrid , fat hobbit . . . . . . who hates smagol . . . . . . and who makes up nasty lies .
you miserable little maggot !
i' il stove your head in !
sam !
call me a liar ?
you' re a liar !
you scare him off , we' re lost !
i don' t care !
i can' t do it , mr. frodo .
i won' t wait around for him to kill us !
i' m not sending him away .
you don' t see it , do you ?
he' s a villain .
we can' t do this by ourselves , sam .
not without a guide .
i need you on my side .
i' m on your side , mr. frodo .
i know , sam .
i know .
trust me .
come , smagol .
the stars are veiled .
something stirs in the east .
a sleepless malice .
the eye of the enemy is moving .
what are you doing ?
pippin !
pippin ?
pippin .
what , are you mad ?
i just want to look at it .
just one more time .
put it back .
pippin .
no !
pippin .
he is here .
i see you .
pippin !
help !
gandalf , help !
someone help him !
pippin !
fool of a took !
look at me .
gandalf , forgive me .
look at me .
what did you see ?
a tree .
there was a white tree . . . . . . in a courtyard of stone .
it was dead .
the city was burning .
minas tirith ? ls that what you saw ?
i saw . . . .
i saw him .
i could hear his voice in my head .
and what did you tell him ?
speak !
he asked me my name .
i didn' t answer .
he hurt me .
what did you tell him about frodo and the ring ?
there was no lie in pippin' s eyes .
a fool . . . . . . but an honest fool he remains .
he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring .
we' ve been strangely fortunate .
pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy' s plan .
sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith .
his defeat at helm' s deep showed our enemy one thing .
he knows the heir of elendil has come forth .
men are not as weak as he supposed .
there is courage still , strength enough perhaps to challenge him .
sauron fears this .
he will not risk the peoples of middle earth uniting under one banner .
he will raze minas tirith to the ground . . . . . . before he sees a king return to the throne of men .
lf the beacons of gondor are lit , rohan must be ready for war .
tell me . . . . . . why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours ?
what do we owe gondor ?
i will go .
no !
they must be warned .
they will be .
you must come to minas tirith by another road .
follow the river and look to the black ships .
things are now in motion that cannot be undone .
i ride for minas tirith . . .
. . . and i won' t be going alone .
of all the inquisitive hobbits , peregrin took , you are the worst .
hurry !
hurry !
where are we going ?
why did you look ?
why do you always have to look ?
i don' t know .
i can' t help it .
you never can .
i' m sorry , all right ?
i won' t do it again .
don' t you understand ?
the enemy thinks you have the ring .
he' s going to be looking for you , pip .
they have to get you out of here .
and you ?
you' re coming with me ?
merry ?
come on .
how far is minas tirith ?
three days ' ride , as the nazgl flies .
and you better hope we don' t have one of those on our tail .
here .
something for the road .
the last of the longbottom leaf .
i know you' ve run out .
you smoke too much , pippin .
but but we' il see each other soon .
won' t we ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know what' s going to happen .
merry .
run , shadowfax .
show us the meaning of haste .
merry !
merry !
take her by the safest road .
a ship lies anchored in the grey havens .
it waits to carry her across the sea .
the last journey of arwen u ndmiel .
there is nothing for you here . . . . . . only death .
lady arwen . . . . . . we cannot delay .
my lady !
tell me what you have seen .
arwen .
you have the gift of foresight .
what did you see ?
i looked into your future , and i saw death .
but there is also life .
you saw there was a child .
you saw my son .
that future is almost gone .
but it is not lost .
nothing is certain .
some things are certain .
lf i leave him now . . . . . .
i will regret it forever .
it is time .
from the ashes a fire shall be woken
a light from the shadow shall spring
renewed shall be blade that was broken
the crownless again shall be king
re forge the sword .
your hands are cold .
the life of the eldar is leaving you .
this was my choice .
whether by your will or not . . .
. . . there is no ship now that can bear me hence .
we' ve just passed into the realm of gondor .
minas tirith .
city of kings .
make way !
it' s the tree .
gandalf .
gandalf .
yes , the white tree of gondor .
the tree of the king .
lord denethor , however , is not king .
he is a steward only , a caretaker of the throne .
now listen carefully .
lord denethor is boromir' s father .
to give him news of his beloved son' s death would be most unwise .
and do not mention frodo or the ring .
and say nothing of aragorn either .
i n fact , it' s better if you don' t speak at all , peregrin took .
hail denethor , son of ecthelion , lord and steward of gondor .
i come with tidings in this dark hour , and with counsel .
perhaps you come to explain this .
perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead .
boromir died to save us . . . . . . my kinsman and me .
he fell defending us from many foes .
pippin .
i offer you my service , such as it is . . . . . . in payment of this debt .
get up .
my lord , there will be a time to grieve for boromir . . . . . . but it is not now .
war is coming .
the enemy is on your doorstep .
as steward , you are charged . . . . . . with the defense of this city .
where are gondor' s armies ?
you still have friends .
you are not alone in this fight .
send word to thoden of rohan .
light the beacons .
you think you are wise , mithrandir .
yet for all your subtleties , you have not wisdom .
do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind ?
i have seen more than you know .
with your left hand you would use me as a shield against mordor .
and with your right you' d seek to supplant me .
i know who rides with thoden of rohan .
oh , yes .
word has reached my ears of this aragorn , son of arathorn .
and i tell you now , i will not bow to this ranger from the north . . . . . . last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship .
authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king , steward .
the rule of gondor is mine and no other' s .
come .
so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position .
i mean , they don' t actually expect me to do any fighting .
do they ?
you' re in the service of the steward now .
you' re going to have to do as you' re told , peregrin took , guard of the citadel .
it' s so quiet .
it' s the deep breath before the plunge .
i don' t want to be in a battle . . . . . . but waiting on the edge of one i can' t escape is even worse .
ls there any hope , gandalf , for frodo and sam ?
there never was much hope .
just a fool' s hope .
our enemy is ready .
his full strength' s gathered .
not only orcs , but men as well .
legions of haradrim from the south . . . . . . mercenaries from the coast .
all will answer mordor' s call .
come on .
this will be the end of gondor as we know it .
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest .
lf the river is taken , if the garrison at osgiliath falls . . . . . . the last defense of this city will be gone .
but we have the white wizard .
that' s got to count for something .
gandalf ?
sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant . . . . . . the one who will lead mordor' s armies in war .
the one they say no living man can kill .
the witch king of angmar .
you' ve met him before .
he stabbed frodo on weathertop .
he is the lord of the nazgl . . . . . . the greatest of the nine .
minas morgul is his lair .
the dead city .
very nasty place .
full of enemies .
quick .
quick .
they will see .
they will see .
come away .
come away .
look , we have found it .
the way into mordor .
the secret stair .
climb .
no , mr. frodo !
not that way !
what' s it doing ?
no .
they' re calling me .
no .
hide !
hide !
i can feel his blade .
we come to it at last .
the great battle of our time .
come away , hobbits .
we climb .
we must climb .
the board is set .
the pieces are moving .
peregrin took , my lad , there is a task now to be done .
another opportunity for one of the shire folk to prove their great worth .
you must not fail me .
quiet .
to the river .
quick .
quick .
go .
go .
come on .
faster .
draw swords .
hold !
hold !
what ?
amon d n .
the beacon .
the beacon of amon d n is lit .
hope is kindled .
the beacons of minas tirith !
the beacons are lit !
gondor calls for aid .
and rohan will answer .
muster the rohirrim .
assemble the army at dunharrow .
as many men as can be found .
you have two days .
on the third , we ride for gondor and war .
forward .
very good , sir .
gamling .
my lord .
make haste across the riddermark .
summon every able bodied man to dunharrow .
i will .
will you ride with us ?
just to the encampment .
it' s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men .
the men have found their captain .
they will follow you into battle , even to death .
you have given us hope .
so it is before the walls of minas tirith . . . . . . the doom of our time will be decided .
now is the hour .
riders of rohan , oaths you have taken .
now , fulfill them all .
to lord and land !
faramir !
we can' t hold them .
the city is lost .
tell the men to break cover .
we ride for minas tirith .
nazgl .
take cover !
nazgl !
fall back .
fall back to minas tirith !
fall back !
retreat !
retreat !
come on !
the age of men is over .
the time of the orc has come .
take cover !
take cover , my lord !
it' s coming !
it' s mithrandir .
the white rider !
pull !
mithrandir .
they broke through our defenses .
they' ve taken the bridge and the west bank .
battalions of orcs are crossing the river .
it is as the lord denethor predicted .
long has he foreseen this doom .
foreseen and done nothing .
faramir ?
this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path .
no .
you' ve seen frodo and sam ?
where ?
when ?
i n lthilien .
not two days ago .
gandalf , they' re taking the road to the morgul vale .
and then the pass of cirith ungol .
what does that mean ?
what' s wrong ?
faramir , tell me everything .
careful , master .
careful .
very far to fall .
very dangerous are the stairs .
come , master .
come to smagol .
mr. frodo .
get back , you !
don' t touch him !
why does he hates poor smagol ?
what has smagol ever done to him ?
master ?
master carries heavy burden .
smagol knows .
heavy , heavy burden .
fat one cannot know .
smagol look after master .
he wants it .
he needs it .
smagol sees it in his eye .
very soon he will ask you for it .
you will see .
the fat one will take it from you .
send forth all legions .
do not stop the attack until the city is taken .
slay them all .
what of the wizard ?
i will break him .
what of thoden' s riders ?
will rohan' s army come ?
mithrandir .
courage is the best defense that you have now .
here do i swear fealty and service to gondor . . . . . . in peace or war . . . . . . in living or dying . . .
. . . from . . . .
from this hour henceforth . . . . . . until my lord release me . . .
. . . or death take me .
and i shall not forget it . . . . . . nor fail to reward that which is given .
fealty with love .
valor with honor .
disloyalty with vengeance .
i do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses . . . . . . defenses that your brother long held intact .
what would you have me do ?
i will not yield . . . . . . the river in pelennor unfought .
osgiliath must be retaken .
my lord , osgiliath is overrun .
much must be risked in war .
ls there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord' s will ?
you wish now that our places had been exchanged . . . . . . that i had died and boromir had lived .
yes .
i wish that .
since you were robbed of boromir . . .
. . .
i will do what i can in his stead .
lf i should return , think better of me , father .
that will depend on the manner of your return .
what are you up to ?
sneaking off , are we ?
sneaking ?
sneaking ?
fat hobbit is always so polite .
smagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find . . . . . . and they say " sneak .
sneak ?
very nice friend .
oh , yes , my precious .
very nice , very nice .
all right .
all right !
you just startled me is all .
what were you doing ?
sneaking .
fine .
have it your own way .
i' m sorry to wake you , mr. frodo .
we have to be moving on .
it' s dark still .
it' s always dark here .
it' s gone !
the elven bread .
what ?
that' s all we have left .
he took it .
he must have !
smagol ?
no , no , not poor smagol .
smagol hates nasty elf bread .
you' re a lying wretch !
what did you do with it ? !
he doesn' t eat it .
he can' t have taken it .
look .
what' s this ?
crumbs on his jacketses .
he took it !
he took it .
i seen him .
he' s always stuffing his face when master' s not looking .
that' s a filthy lie !
you stinking , two faced sneak !
sam !
call me
stop it !
sam !
i' il kill him !
sam !
no !
oh , my i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it to go so far .
i was just so so angry .
here , just let' s just rest a bit .
i' m all right .
no .
no , you' re not all right .
you' re exhausted .
it' s that gollum .
it' s this place .
it' s that thing around your neck .
i could help a bit .
i could carry it for a while .
carry it for a while .
i could carry it . . .
i could carry it .
share the load . . . share the load . . . the load . . . the load .
get away !
i don' t want to keep it .
i just want to help .
see ?
see ?
he wants it for himself .
shut up , you !
go away !
get out of here !
no , sam .
it' s you .
i' m sorry , sam .
but he' s a liar .
he' s poisoned you against me .
you can' t help me anymore .
you don' t mean that .
go home .
faramir !
faramir !
your father' s will has turned to madness .
do not throw away your life so rashly .
where does my allegiance lie if not here ?
your father loves you , faramir .
he will remember it before the end .
can you sing , master hobbit ?
well . . . . . . yes .
at least , well enough for my own people .
but we have no songs for great halls . . .
. . . and evil times .
and why should your songs be unfit for my halls ?
come , sing me a song .
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
u ntil the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
march !
march !
march !
march !
march !
make way for the king .
make way .
the king is here .
my lord .
hail to you , sire .
grimbold , how many ?
i bring 500 men from the westfold , my lord .
we have 300 more from fenmarch , thoden king .
where are the riders from snowbourn ?
none have come , my lord .
six thousand spears .
less than half of what i' d hoped for .
six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor .
more will come .
every hour lost hastens gondor' s defeat .
we have till dawn , then we must ride .
the horses are restless . . . . . . and the men are quiet .
they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain .
that road there . . . . . . where does that lead ?
it is the road to the dimholt , the door under the mountain .
none who venture there ever return .
that mountain is evil .
aragorn .
let' s find some food .
there .
a true esquire of rohan .
i' m ready .
sorry .
it isn' t all that dangerous .
it' s not even sharp .
well , that' s no good .
you won' t kill many orcs with a blunt blade .
come on .
to the smithy .
go !
you should not encourage him .
you should not doubt him .
i do not doubt his heart , only the reach of his arm .
why should merry be left behind ?
he has as much cause to go to war as you .
why can he not fight for those he loves ?
i choose a mortal life .
i wish i could' ve seen him . . .
. . . one last time .
sir ?
king thoden awaits you , my lord .
i take my leave .
my lord elrond .
i come on behalf of one whom i love .
arwen is dying .
she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from mordor .
the light of the evenstar is failing .
as sauron' s power grows , her strength wanes .
arwen' s life is now tied to the fate of the ring .
the shadow is upon us , aragorn .
the end has come .
it will not be our end , but his .
you ride to war , but not to victory .
sauron' s armies march on minas tirith , this you know .
but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river .
a fleet of corsairs ships sails from the south .
they' il be in the city in two days .
you' re outnumbered , aragorn .
you need more men .
there are none .
there are those who dwell in the mountain .
murderers . . . . . . traitors .
you would call upon them to fight ?
they believe in nothing .
they answer to no one .
they will answer to the king of gondor .
andril , the flame of the west , forged from the shards of narsil .
sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil .
the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith .
the man who can wield the power of this sword . . . . . . can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth .
put aside the ranger .
become who you were born to be .
take the dimholt road .
why are you doing this ?
the war lies to the east .
you cannot leave on the eve of battle .
you cannot abandon the men .
owyn . . . .
we need you here .
why have you come ?
do you not know ?
it is but a shadow and a thought that you love .
i cannot give you what you seek .
just where do you think you' re off to ?
not this time .
this time you must stay , gimli .
have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves ?
you might as well accept it .
we' re going with you , laddie .
what' s happening ?
where is he going ?
where' s he going ?
i don' t understand .
lord aragorn !
why does he leave on the eve of battle ?
he leaves because there is no hope .
he leaves because he must .
too few have come .
we cannot defeat the armies of mordor .
no . . . . . . we cannot .
but we will meet them in battle nonetheless .
i have left instruction .
the people are to follow your rule in my stead .
take up my seat in the golden hall .
long may you defend edoras . . . . . . if the battle goes ill .
what other duty would you have me do , my lord ?
duty ?
no .
i would have you smile again . . .
. . . not grieve for those whose time has come .
you shall live to see these days renewed . . .
. . . and no more despair .
what kind of army would linger in such a place ?
one that is cursed .
long ago , the men of the mountains swore an oath . . . . . . to the last king of gondor . . . . . . to come to his aid . . . . . . to fight .
but when the time came . . . . . . when gondor' s need was dire . . . . . . they fled . . . . . . vanishing into the darkness of the mountain .
and so lsildur cursed them . . .
. . . never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge .
the very warmth of my blood seems stole away .
the way is shut .
it was made by those who are dead .
and the dead keep it .
the way is shut .
brego !
i do not fear death .
well , this is a thing unheard of .
an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not ?
oh .
oh , i' d never hear the end of it .
we must ride light and swift .
it is a long road ahead .
and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight .
little hobbits do not belong in war , master meriadoc .
all my friends have gone to battle .
i would be ashamed to be left behind .
it is a three day gallop to minas tirith .
and none of my riders can bear you as a burden .
i want to fight .
i will say no more .
ride with me .
my lady .
form up !
move out !
form up !
move out !
ride !
ride now to gondor !
who enters my domain ?
one who will have your allegiance .
the dead do not suffer the living to pass .
you will suffer me .
the way is shut .
it was made by those who are dead .
and the dead keep it .
the way is shut .
now you must die .
i summon you to fulfill your oath .
none but the king of gondor may command me .
that line was broken .
it has been remade .
fight for us . . . . . . and regain your honor .
what say you ?
what say you ?
