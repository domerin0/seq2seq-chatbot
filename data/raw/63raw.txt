we can always find a use for that type .
i told you before , you' ve got to look tough .

and try to stay awake .
it' s tiring being tough .
tiring ?
it' s our living !
the streets out there are filled with money and women .
you only need the will and determination ... ... to seize the opportunity to win .
this is our big chance !
we just kill someone , and we' re in the gang .
then it' il be money and women all the way !
don' t be like those beggars ... ... with no ambition .
who are you looking at , four eyes ?
i' il smash your glasses !
get lost !
come here and say that !
you' re really gonna kill someone ?
that' s right !
the four eyes , the fat woman and all the residents of pig sty .
but they' re good at kung fu .
i can do kung fu !
oh , yeah ?
didn' t i tell you i know buddhist palm kung fu ?
hey there , handsome boy .
stop .
amazing !
do you know you have a special aura ?
you' re so young , but you have the bone structure ... and chi flow of a kung fu genius .
if your chi flow can be channeled , then you will be invincible !
you cannot escape your destiny .
the duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours .
sure .
this is the scroll of the buddhist palm .
it' s priceless .
but as it' s fate , i' il let you have it for $ 10 .
buddhlst palm manual
you gave him your life savings ?
yes .
i was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer ... ... but this was world peace .
let go of the girl !
hey !
it' s the buddhist palm !
the 20 cent kung fu manual .
you must be loaded .
have you killed anyone lately ?
he' s a fool , and she' s mute .
losers !
i realized then that good guys never win .
i want to be bad .
i want to be the killer !
ice cream !
where ?
make mine a vanilla .
chocolate for me !
what' re you looking at ?
never seen free ice cream before ?
look at her run !
you' re such kung fu masters , go take it on the road .
you belong in the circus , not here !
don' t say that , landlady .
there must be a reason they' re here .
everyone has his reasons .
we don' t want to make trouble .
i' m glad you get it .
the mob' s mad at us .
we' il never hear the end of it .
why don' t you get lost !
your wife shouldn' t be so nasty .
you okay ?
masters .
we have nothing precious to give you ... ... but take this as a token of our appreciation .
thanks for saving us !
stop the crying .
this isn' t a show !
you' re so cold hearted .
talking back to me , eh ?
you may know kung fu , but you' re still a fairy .
it' s no crime to be good at kung fu !
once a fairy , always a fairy .
look at you .
what' s with the red underwear ?
why not a diaper while you' re at it .
what' s wrong with red underwear ?
where were you when there was trouble ?
if it weren' t for them , we' d be finished .
be reasonable !
i' il reason with you .
you owe me three months ' rent .
that' s $90 .
pay up or pack up !
don' t you worry .
i' il pay it .
think you' re a smartass , rabbit tooth jane ?
what' s it to you , tub of lard ?
bitch !
calm down , landlady .
this is your fault .
are you trying to kill us ?
you' re right .
how could you do that ?
shut the hell up !
you think you can out yell me ?
the fat lady can really sing .
watch this !
what happened ?
what do you mean , what happened ?
you try it .
me ?
quick !
sorry !
you okay ?
i think you should get closer and take better aim .
okay ?
okay !
who' s throwing the handles ?
handle ?
where' s the third knife ?
god knows where it went .
could it be the same one ?
can' t be ...
don' t !
sorry .
what are you trying to say ?
i just remembered i have something to do .
see you !
uh oh .
they' ve seen us !
stay back !
don' t panic !
snakes like music .
if i whistle , they won' t bite .
please , no more bright ideas .
oh , what the hell !
not you again , asshole !
get back to your business !
split up !
split ?
what' re you doing here ?
looking for you .
weren' t you hurt ?
i' m fine !
how come you always recover so fast ?
i don' t know .
which hospital did you go to ?
don' t remember .
maybe it' s better that way .
memories can be painful .
to forget may be a blessing !
i never knew you were so deep .
all the sadness one can bear ...
... down the river everywhere .
hey , get out of the way !
move !
i' il slap you to kingdom come !
look at those four eyes carting around a coffin .
what morons !
don' t blame me for making you leave .
we' il let buddha decide ... ... whether you stay ... ... or go .
horrlfically bad fate
have some tea .
we' re grateful for some professional help .
we understand the problem .
twelve kicks from the tam school ... ... iron fist from the hung school and the hexagon staff ...
those guys at pig sty are really good .
their warrior days are long over ... ... but they' re still top fighters .
this job is a great challenge for us .
now , that' s professionalism .
number one killers .
expensive , yes , but worth every penny !
no !
number one is the beast , the world' s top killer .
he was so dedicated to kung fu , he went crazy .
i heard he' s now in an asylum .
so you' re the top killers now .
strictly speaking , we' re just musicians .
a song that wrenches the heart o where do i find a knowing ear ?
great poem , isn' t it ?
we' il be saying goodbye soon .
who knows when we' il see each other again .
we' re three of a kind .
wish we' d known before .
let' s take this opportunity to spar a little .
no .
we still have a lot to pack .
you' re right .
twelve kicks of the tam school !
superb attack and defense !
powerful yet delicate .
topnotch !
hexagon staff , with its thousand moves .
mystical !
till we meet again !
more lipstick !
stay there , or i' il break you in half .
sorry , we' re closed .
you can make a suit in no time .
we' re moving .
this is good material !
you know your stuff .
this has high artistic value .
how high ?
at least a few stories ...
insulting the axe gang !
we' il show them .
let' s kill them all and make this place a brothel .
don' t block my view !
what' s going on ?
good !
don' t block my view !
damn !
i told those nitwits to leave , but they' re still here .
really ?
yeah .
what the hell is this fighting ?
who' il pay for the damage ?
sorry , sorry .
it' s nothing !
you know what time it is ?
i have to sleep .
hey , fatso , eat shit and die !
die ?
in this racket ?
sorry , sorry !
get out of my way !
hang in there , tailor .
be quiet !
give us a break !
why push us so far ?
there' s another master ?
it' s the lion' s roar !
i thought that was a myth .
who knew the lion' s roar really exists ?
that' s the last we' il see of them .
it' s bad , brother sum .
quick , start the car !
start the car !
boss !
keep it down !
have you no manners ?
get lost .
people are trying to sleep .
they have to work tomorrow .
get out of here !
scumbags !
i can' t hang on much longer .
but having seen real masters like you ... ... i can now die in peace .
don' t say that .
we' re ordinary folks .
ordinary' s a blessing .
don' t call us masters .
but you' re such great fighters !
if only you' d helped earlier , they wouldn' t have to die this way .
like donut said , everyone has his reasons .
years ago ... ... we saw our only son killed in a fight .
revenge can be devastating .
do you understand ?
why don' t you train us to be top fighters ... ... and we' il avenge them !
becoming a top fighter takes time .
unless you' re a natural born kung fu genius .
and they' re one in a million .
it' s obvious i' m the one !
don' t think so .
everyone !
we swore we' d never fight again .
but we broke that promise today .
for your own safety , please all leave !
in great power lies great responsibility .
there' s no escaping from it .
donut , you' re hurt bad .
rest now .
we can' t understand what you' re saying .
donut !
i know you , four eyes !
you seem prejudiced against the sight challenged .
that' s right .
especially gold framed four eyes .
gold frames are perfect for clerks .
i think i look good .
so why keep picking on me ?
help me !
help me !
help me !
want to play , punks ?
the dragon style ?
the tiger style ?
come down here , and i' il smash your glasses .
come on !
you know i' d do it , right ?
swear to it !
swear !
have you no respect ?
where were you when i needed you ?
you sound like a wimp !
we always get beat !
we haven' t gotten anywhere .
no killing , no arson , no robberies , no rapes ... ... all because of you !
you' re a numb nut !
follow me !
it' s a stickup !
where' s the money ?
where' s the money ?
what' re you looking at ?
i' m serious !
i kill people for less !
give me the money .
the money' s in here .
let go of the girl !
he' s a fool , and she' s mute .
losers !
go away !
you' re dragging me down !
go home and raise pigs .
go , before i kill you .
you !
whatsyourname !
take this and get some new clothes .
you' re now an axe !
for real ?
someone' s waiting for you .
brother sum !
one look at you , and i knew you' d do anything .
right !
you just needed your chance .
damn right !
we' ve an assignment for you .
anything , brother sum !
research on abnormal people .
what' s that ?
a mental asylum .
soldiers !
boy scouts !
tanks !
no worries .
when the boy scouts change shifts , you have exactly five minutes .
follow the arrows on the map .
go to the last cell ... ... and get the man inside there out .
here' s your tools .
what about you guys ?
we' re your lookouts .
five minutes .
hurry !
the world' s top killer indeed looks the part !
it' s only a title .
cut the bullshit .
we want two people killed .
name your price .
name my what ?
i' ve killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary .
so far , i' ve never found one .
that' s why i stayed inside .
had i met my match , i' d have been out long ago .
if you find me a worthy opponent ... ... i' il do it for free .
no charge !
do you have someone ?
yes .
brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge .
but first , will you show us some moves ?
not that we don' t trust you .
we want to see you in action .
you numskulls aren' t worthy !
he doesn' t look the part .
the slippers are a little crappy .
but he' il clean up well .
you sure you got the right guy ?
absolutely .
i swear i did exactly what you told me .
please show us some moves , mr. beast .
don' t make it hard for me !
you dumb or what ?
you know what this is , old man ?
ever seen a fist this big ?
don' t force me to fight .
i scare myself when i fight !
really ?
try me , then .
is he okay ?
so you say you can fight ?
harder !
harder !
harder !
you hit like that and call yourself a gangster ?
a foreign gun !
in the world of kung fu , speed defines the winner .
the beast is the best of them all .
the axe gang extends its respect !
the real masters , together in one room !
only the world' s top killer ... ... has such an aura .
likewise .
could you two be the fated lovers ... ?
paris ... ... and helen of troy !
a pleasure , indeed .
we' re here to deal with the axe gang ... ... and only the axe gang .
you should' ve killed me before .
now you' re committing suicide .
you' re living on borrowed time .
you can' t escape your fate !
what' s this ?
a funeral bell ?
with the beast here , let' s see whose funeral it is !
so you' re on their side ?
don' t get me wrong .
i only want to kill you ... ... or be killed by you .
what do you think ?
the good cannot coexist with the bad .
you can' t escape your destiny .
so be it .
let' s do it .
okay .
let' s do it !
piece of cake .
i can handle this .
good try , but a little off target .
the lion' s roar ?
wait !
i didn' t know the lion' s roar could be done with a speaker !
what a blow !
looks like they' re not up to it !
let' s get them while they' re down .
you do it !
i' m gonna puke !
i need to see a doctor !
go to hell !
you !
come over here .
hit him !
yes !
the head !
of course !
hit him on the head !
okay .
here' s your chance .
got it !
hit him !
hit him !
hit the shit out of him !
right !
hit him !
hit him !
beat the shit out of him !
what' re you doing ?
you want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him ?
you' re making me very confused !
wow , that' s a big fist !
why did you hit me ?
where are they ?
how could you let them escape ?
no one gets away from me !
why did he save us ?
young people make mistakes .
but at least he finally made good .
look at him !
beaten to a pulp .
do you have any last requests ?
hey , wait !
why don' t you write in chinese ?
i don' t understand .
there' s no one here !
chlnese medlcine
it' s a miracle he lasted this long .
the herbs should help him .
herbal medicine can only partly help .
the key is his own body structure .
all his bones and tendons are broken .
it' s amazing he' s recovering so fast .
it can' t be possible ...
unless he' s ...
what' s that smell ?
you mustn' t smoke while you' re hurt .
let me handle this .
this makes no sense .
who knew the beast could clear the chi flow ... ... and thus unleash the boy' s true potential ?
we should' ve guessed .
he is the one !
is this for real ?
you' re still alive , you turncoat ?
kill him , men !
what kind of move is that ?
kids ' stuff !
if our son were alive , he' d be his age now .
if he studies hard , he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer .
a stuntman , more likely !
not bad .
let' s go .
i can even stop bullets ...
what ?
the toad style of the kwan lun school ?
oh , no !
remember the palm move that falls from heaven ?
that' s the long lost buddhist palm .
i surrender !
what kind of move was that ?
if you want to learn , i' il teach you .
master !
hey !
tell him not to put snot on the glass .
you two , put your pants on !
no licking if you' re not buying !
kid , you have the bone structure of a kung fu genius .
world peace is in your hands .
here' s the scroll of the buddhist palm .
because it' s fate , i' il let you have it for $ 10 .
wait !
you want more ... ?
