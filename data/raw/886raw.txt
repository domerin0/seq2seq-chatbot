what i say will not be directed to the children of the double cross but to the children of israel !
that hynkel isn' t such a bad fellow after all .
most amusing .
get a hynkel badge !
a hynkel badge !
a fine photo on each !
we' d better go home .
yeah .
let' s hurry .
wait a minute .
what' s that ?
turn off the radio .
the storm troopers !
bar that door !
get some water !
get the women and children upstairs .
lock all the doors .
you men , stay right here .
we' ve got to make a stand .
we might as well die as live like this .
wait a minute .
we have a social call to make here .
wait a minute !
schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court .
these jews attacked us .
i don' t care .
orders were to keep out .
you saw that !
i can' t help it .
schultz' s orders .
let' s get going .
orders or not , i' m going to get that girl .
out !
schultz arrested !
hear that ?
he' s arrested commander schultz .
a jew corrupted our commander .
let' s kill the louse !
schultz is accused of treason , and you know why .
schultz was a friend of that barber .
let' s get the barber !
we want the barber !
it' s the storm troopers !
get on the roof .
no .
they' il kill you !
i' il fight .
don' t be a fool , you' il be murdered .
get on the roof .
all right , here we are .
smash in the door !
come on , we' il give the barber a haircut !
where are the bombs ?
there goes the barbershop !
never mind .
we can start again .
we can go to osterlich .
that' s still free .
mr jaeckel says it' s beautiful .
wonderful green fields , and they grow apples and grapes .
his brother' s got a vineyard .
mr jaeckel said he' d take me with him .
now we can all go together .
it' il be wonderful living in the country , much better than a smoky old city .
and if we work hard and don' t eat much , we can save money and buy a chicken farm .
there' s money to be made in chickens .
look at that star !
isn' t it beautiful !
hynkel with all his power can never touch that .
all right , the coast is clear .
commander schultz escaped .
he' s hiding in my cellar .
he' s holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there .
hannah , you come and help mrs jaeckel with the supper .
all right , i' il be down .
i don' t understand it .
this crazy midnight supper ...
what does this schultz want of us ?
he wants us to blow up the palace .
what ?
we jewish people shouldn' t get mixed up in such a business .
i know it but schultz has them all hypnotised .
i knew he was up to some mischief .
sure he is .
i found him putting a coin in one of your puddings .
don' t worry , i' ve fixed everything .
wait and see .
gentlemen , may i claim your indulgence for a moment ?
we are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant .
in order to carry this out one of us must die .
in ancient times the aryan tribe of the langobardians made human sacrifice to the god thor .
at a feast by lottery the victim was chosen .
tonight , at this feast , one of you will be chosen .
each man will receive a pudding .
concealed in one of these is a coin .
whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history' s noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant .
i know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for tomainia .
much as i should like to participate in this ordeal , i cannot ...
why ?
don' t you understand ?
he' s too well known .
it must be somebody like us .
i can' t see it like that .
it is a question of my honour .
it is very embarrassing .
commander schultz , i apologise for my friend .
let me say , on behalf of myself and the others , that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country .
very well , then .
gentlemen , i shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator .
until then ...
hail hynk ...
what am i saying ?
gentlemen , we have pledged our honour .
proceed !
gentlemen , the coin is here !
what' s the meaning of this ?
somebody made a fool of us .
i did .
what ?
i put a coin in every pudding .
blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people !
we' re in enough trouble !
hannah' s right .
we' ve all been foolish .
our place is at home , looking after our own affairs .
the papers say schultz may be in the ghetto .
here , read it for yourself .
hannah , read that .
mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex commander schultz .
at police hq it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto .
a certain jewish barber , reported to be a friend of schultz ,
is wanted for questioning .
me ?
only for questioning .
not too serious .
meyerberg was only wanted for questioning .
we never saw him again .
who is it ?
it' s me , mr mann .
did you hear what they' re saying about schultz hiding in the ghetto ?
i know , i know .
don' t you think it' s serious if they find him in the house ?
don' t you realise there are spies everywhere !
spies ?
what' s the matter ?
he' s wanted for questioning .
where' s the commander ?
in the next room .
if commander schultz is found in this house , we' il all go to a concentration camp and have our heads cut off , too !
am i arguing ?
then get rid of him .
you can' t throw him out .
of course not .
but i' d like to know how long he' s going to stay here .
your breakfast is on the table .
thank you .
i have breakfast waiting at home .
search every house .
what now ?
they' re looking for schultz .
he' s in one of these houses .
they' re always looking for somebody .
it' s me .
let me in .
the storm troopers are searching every house .
tell the commander .
did you tell him ?
yes .
what is it ?
the storm troopers .
what ?
you' d both better get on the roof .
we can' t leave all these things .
all of you , pack my cases .
you pack that .
clear this shelf .
pack this and this .
this mustn' t be found .
open the door .
they' re here !
get up on the roof .
nothing left behind !
my golf clubs !
the hatbox !

come on , let' s hurry !
where are you going ?
with him .
you' il see him later .
i' il meet you tonight .

lucky you didn' t break your neck .
you' il pardon me .
i' m sorry .
you guard the back .
wait a minute !
i' il have to bother you again .
there he is .
how are you ?
so so .
here' s your friend .
your silence will be appreciated .
take him to the wagon .
where are you going ?
smoking room .
come on , this way !
osterlich !
i am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on osterlich .
this was made possible by the genius of field marshal herring , upon whom i shall now pin a token of my regard .
turn around .
no !
gentlemen .
to field marshal herring !
to the invasion of osterlich !
elephant !
wait .
napaloni' s army is on the osterlich front .
60, 000 men are on the border .
to take osterlich !
i can' t believe it .
you can' t believe it !
you let him steal a march on us .
i had the ground covered .
declare war on napaloni !
mobilise every division of the army and air force .
attack bacteria at once !
but ...
do as i tell you !
madness .
shut up !
will you sign this ?
what is it ?
a declaration of war .
yes .
a pen !
i' il sign it .
a pen !
i' il sign it !
napaloni ...
it' s napaloni .
wait a minute .
napaloni ?
you talk to him .
what' il i say ?
be nice , affable , pleasant .
well , well , how are you ?
no , he hasn' t been playing much .
you went round in 92 ?
his excellency ?
just now he' s a little hoarse .
no , i mean he can' t talk .
may i take a message ?
he says no doubt you' ve heard about osterlich .
he wants to discuss it .
ask him to come here .
his excellency invites you to tomainia to discuss the matter .
very well .
i' il make the arrangements .
he' s coming .
good .
we' il put on the greatest military show the world has ever known .
napaloni will leave the invasion of osterlich to me .
and this ?
what is it ?
your declaration of war .
peace is declared !
2, 975, 000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting benzino napaloni ,
entering the station is our phooey , ready to greet his guest ,
this will cement the friendship between our phooey and the dictator of bacteria ,
his excellency is about to greet the bacterian ambassador ,
how do you do ?
garbitsch ...
see about the photography .
tell the press to see that our phooey is well photographed .
not the back of his head !
yes , sir .
napaloni' s train is coming into the station ,
from a pink and white carriage
napaloni and his wife will step out and adenoid hynkel will deliver his address of welcome ,
what' s all this mix up a ?
they' ve gone too far .
at ease !
bring the carpet .
why can' t a we get out here ?
no a carpet .
who cares ?
me , napaloni , i never get out without a carpet .
lay it down here .
quick .
it' s going back .
what ?
let' s get out while it' s stopping .
shut up !
take it away !
stay here until they' ve made up their minds .
you got a da carpet .
put it down !
here he is .
my friend !
napaloni !
this is indeed a pleasure .
welcome to tomainia .
this way .
pictures !
sure .
salute !
another , please .
this is a pleasure , my friend hynkel .
you want another ?
there .
where' s a my ambassador ?
hello , spook .
how do you feel ?
look after mamma .
hynky , did you meet a my wife ?
that' s her .
let' s go .
tomainia ... very nice , very nice .
your clock is a slow .
this way .
it' s a very nice people .
the people are very nice .
thank you .
he' s my husband !
you make a mistake !
you make a big a mistake !
napaloni' s army shall not invade osterlich .
it belongs to me !
we shall not discuss the osterlich situation .
this interview is to impress on him the force of your personality .
to make him feel your superiority .
napaloni is aggressive , domineering .
we must put him in his place .
but how ?
by means of psychology .
by making him feel inferior .
this can be done subtly .
for instance ,
i have arranged that he' il be looking up at you , you looking down at him .
his position will be inferior .
then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him .
where is he now ?
resting .
i have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room .
another psychological triumph .
he will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor .
signor napaloni is now leaving his room ,
he' s coming .
quick , give me a flower .
at all times be above him , before him .
entering or leaving you must be first .
hello , hynky !
how are you feel ?
my brother dictate !
you' re a nice a little man .
i' m so glad to see you again .
and my friend the garbitsch !
this is a lovely place .
i feel a fine .
i just had a nice cold shower .
when you have the plumbing fixed it' il be in good shape .
won' t you sit down ?
well , hynky , my dictator friend , you .
i must be a growing !
what do they give me ?
a baby stool ?
this is not for me .
i like it better upstairs .
garbitsch , this is a lovely country .
very nice a people .
i thought the public enthusiastic .
sure .
they like to see new faces .
i' m sorry for the mishap that occurred to madam napaloni .
what' s that ?
i' m sorry for the napaloni that occurred at the ... at ...
madam napaloni at the station .
she' s not used to public life .
she can' t take it .
match .
i' m sorry ...
don' t apologise .
i find a one .
i' m simply crazy about this palace .
ivory and gold .
a lovely combination .
gets away from that gingerbread idea .
tell me something , garbitsch , what' s on the programme ?
the grand ball this evening .
and a review of the army .
that won' t take a long !
i' m afraid it will .
so you got a big army , huh ?
modesty forbids .
seems i' ve heard about it .
i think i' il get me a shave .
we have a barbershop .
is that so ?
you look blue under the gills .
what do you say we go together ?
delighted .
good !
very well , this way .
this is it .
i can a smell ' em .
this is a very sweet .
it was the library .
a good barbershop .
too old fashioned .
is that so ?
when i get shaved i like something to look at .
so i' m putting in glass walls .
this way , i shall have a view of the mountains .
and this , a view through the glass ceiling .
what' s above ?
the ballroom .
in my summer palace i have a barbershop .
is that so ?
also with glass walls .
you don' t tell me !
with goldfish inside .
goldfish swimming inside the walls ?
how do you feed them ?
you can' t , they' re all dead .
that' s why i' m building a new one .
very interesting !
you like it ?
the hynkel stadium , before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review ,
our beloved phooey and i' il dig a ditchy are seated , thrilled by this historic event ,
what ?
nothing .
i' m just chewing .
some peanuts ?
i' ve had some .
good shape .
here you are , spook .
now passing , tomainia' s heavy artillery ,
it' s all right .
i want to show you my new bombing planes .
they' re coming over .
where from ?
aroma .
aroma ?
that' s 400 miles away .
right .
i don' t know what' s detaining them .
now passing , tomainia' s light artillery ,
very light !
and here come the armoured tanks , the pride of tomainia' s army ,
the latest design , the last word in modern warfare ,
where' s the propellers ?
for going under the water !
under water ?
you never heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up a stairs ?
what' s that ?
under the water and in the air .
obsolete now !
we' re concentrating on flying dreadnoughts .
what' s that ?
my planes !
now passing , hynkel' s flying division number 34 ,
our planes !
you' re right .
they' re yours .
garbitsch !
the invasion of osterlich .
our troops , tanks and guns will be hidden along the border .
to disarm suspicion , you will go hunting .
then you will show up at pretzelburg , meet the army , step into a car and cross over into osterlich .
herring and i will be waiting at the capital .
first napaloni must remove his troops .
to be decided tonight .
where is napaloni ?
i' il look for him .
it might be advisable for you to dance with madam napaloni .
it' il carry weight .
you mean i will !
you find him !
and let me know at once .
madam napaloni ...
your excellency !
why so triste ?
because i no speak .
no ?
may i have the pleasure ?
allow me .
madam , your dancing was superb .
excellent .
very good .
good .
my dear adenoid .
benzino !
i' ve been looking for you .
let' s go to some quiet place where we can talk a things over .
as you wish .
an excellent idea .
to the buffet !
of course , this way .
there' s a tomainian proverb ...
funny .
i wish i understand it .
now about the border .
yes .
no problem .
it should be no trouble .
what' s the matter ?
wait .
you , too .
out !
out .
so ... the border question .
yes .
it' s just a matter of detail .
formalities .
strawberries !
have you any english mustard ?
english mustard .
that' s da hot a stuff ?
very hot .
good shape .
cream .
hynky , i' m going to make this very simple .
you agree not to invade osterlich ,
i agree not to invade osterlich .
we sign , then i remove my troops from the border .
when your troops are gone , i sign .
that' s a right .
just a minute , you don' t understand .
first we sign , then i remove a da troops .
precisely .
i sign after .
just a minute .
hey , spook , treaty .
hold a dis .
now , look , you sign a dis treaty first .
then i remove my troops after .
why are we arguing ?
you said i remove first .
i can' t sign while they' re there .
i won' t remove them till you sign .
why not ?
why should i ?
osterlich is a free country !
your soldiers are there .
and they' il stay until you sign .
i' il blow them off .
this won' t get us anywhere .
to quote an old latin phrase ...
strawberries !
where' s a my sandwich ?
another one !
i don' t get this treatment in my own joint !
can' t we discuss this without passion ?
i' m not a passionate .
i' m just ...
i want him to sign the treaty .
what would my people think , signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border ?
i won' t move until you sign !
not until you clear the border will i sign !
then they remain .
then i kick them off .
one move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces !
and my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that !
you want a start a world war ?
you and the world i' il throw in the ocean !
strawberries !
your excellency , we have ...
i got a my guns here in the pass and i' il blow him to pieces .
what' s the matter ?
what ails you ?
this isn' t like you .
hey , garbitsch , come here .
what' s with hynky ?
mustard on his strawberries .
what else can you expect from hynky ?
my little bambino !
the bacterian ...
tomainia ...
you cannot treat bacteria this way .
i' il take the bacterian people and tear them apart , like this !
look what he' s doing !
it' s an insult to my people !
he' s a tearing spaghetti !
he sign a the treaty or we have a war !
give me a something !
quick , give me a something !
i have an appointment .
what' s this ?
press .
how' s the conference progressing ?
very successfully .
how did you get in ?
how did he get here ?
you know the regulations about reporters .
no one is to enter the palace under any circumstances , understand ?
there are minor details to be cleaned up ...
excuse me , we' re busy .
the whole world will know we' re fighting !
so what ?
can' t we come to an agreement ?
when he signs .
i sign nothing .
i must speak to you alone .
do you mind ?
mind ?
i don' t mind !
sign !
sign !
he' il have the advantage .
it' s a mere scrap of paper .
when his troops are off the border , we can move in .
i' il sign .
what ?
hold a this .
ah , my little hynky !
my dictator brother !
i knew we have a no trouble .
two prisoners escaped in officers ' uniforms .
sound the alarm !
two prisoners escaped .
the planes are searching for us .
the woods .
no , the open .
the border' s that way .
the invasion of osterlich .
now or never .
ducks .
did you hear that ?
it came from over there .
a yodeller .
where did you get that outfit ?
what ?
don' t answer back !
where' s schultz ?
you won' t talk , eh ?
he will when we get him to camp .
come on .
there it is .
the village of pretzelburg .
if we can pass through there we' re safe .
through the woods ?
they' re swarming with soldiers .
they' d suspect us at once .
if you see anyone , don' t look right or left .
we must bluff our way through .
here they come .
can you see what they' re doing ?
looking this way .
keep going !
they' re following us .
shall we run ?
certainly not .
just a little bit ?
keep walking !
we could walk faster .
make up your mind .
slow down ?
no !
there' s no hurry .
he' s here !
sound assembly !
attention !
present arms !
turn back ?
no , keep going !
hail hynkel !
your excellency , everything is under control .
good .
good .
i have been in communication with marshal herring in osterlich .
the route is well guarded .
behind us are 200 tanks , 50 armoured cars and 500 machine guns .
good .
good .
are we ready to start ?
yes .
yes .
gentlemen .
schultz , i' m happy you' re with us again .
thank you .
where are we going ?
you' re invading osterlich .
they' re coming .
your excellency .
the world awaits your words .
what' s happened ?
he looks strange .
what' s schultz doing here ?
pardoned , i suppose .
his excellency herr garbitsch ,
secretary of the interior , minister of propaganda ...
corona veniet delectis ,
victory shall come to the worthy .
today , democracy , liberty and equality are words to fool the people .
no nation can progress with such ideas .
they stand in the way of action .
therefore , we abolish them .
in the future , each man will serve the state with absolute obedience .
let him who refuses beware !
citizenship will be taken away from all jews and non aryans .
they are inferior and therefore enemies of the state .
it is the duty of all true aryans to hate and despise them .
this nation is annexed to the tomainian empire , and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader , the dictator of tomainia , the conqueror of osterlich , the future emperor of the world !
you must speak .
i can' t .
you must .
it' s our only hope .
hope ...
i' m sorry but i don' t want to be an emperor .
that' s not my business .
i don' t want to rule or conquer anyone .
jew , gentile , black man , white .
we all want to help one another .
human beings are like that .
we want to live by each other' s happiness , not misery .
we don' t want to hate one another .
in this world , the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone .
the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way .
greed has poisoned men' s souls , has barricaded the world with hate , has goose stepped us into bloodshed .
we have developed speed but have shut ourselves in .
machinery has left us in want .
our knowledge has made us cynical , our cleverness , hard and unkind .
we think too much and feel too little .
more than machinery we need humanity .
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness .
without these qualities , life will be violent and all will be lost ...
the aeroplane and radio have brought us closer .
these inventions cry out for the goodness in man , cry out for universal brotherhood , for the unity of us all .
even now my voice is reaching millions , millions of despairing men , women and children , victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people .
to those who can hear me i say , do not despair .
the misery upon us is but the passing of greed , the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress .
the hate of men will pass , and dictators die , and the power they took will return to the people .
so long as men die liberty will never perish .
soldiers , don' t give yourselves to brutes , men who despise you , enslave you , regiment your lives , tell you what to think and feel , who drill you , treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder .
don' t give yourselves to these men , machine men with machine minds and machine hearts .
you are not machines , you are not cattle , you are men !
you have the love of humanity in you .
don' t hate .
only the unloved and the unnatural hate .
soldiers , don' t fight for slavery , fight for liberty !
st luke says , " the kingdom of god is within man .
not in one man nor a group of men , but in all men .
in you !
you have the power to create machines , the power to create happiness .
you have the power to make this life free and beautiful , to make this life a wonderful adventure .
in the name of democracy , let us use that power .
let us all unite , let us fight for a new world , a world that will give men a chance to work , that will give youth a future and old age security .
promising these things , brutes have risen .
but they lie !
they do not fulfil that promise .
they never will !
dictators free themselves but they enslave the people .
now let us fight to fulfil that promise !
let us fight to free the world , to do away with national barriers , to do away with greed , with hate and intolerance .
let us fight for a world of reason , a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all .
soldiers , in the name of democracy ,
let us unite !
hannah , can you hear me ?
wherever you are , look up , hannah .
the clouds are lifting , the sun is breaking through .
we are coming out of the darkness into a new world , a kindlier world , where men will rise above their hate , their greed and their brutality .
look up , hannah .
the soul of man has been given wings .
he is flying into the rainbow , into the light of hope , into the future , the glorious future that belongs to you , to me and to all of us .
look up , hannah .
look up !
did you hear that ?
listen ...
