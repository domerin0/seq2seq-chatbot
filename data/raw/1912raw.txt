ah , satan , mon cher .
you are late ce soir .
still looking for your girlfriend , huh ?
mademoiselle dandelo has found another .
you will never see her again .
but don' t you worry .
there will be others .
y en a toujours .
ne t' en fais pas .
madame ?
yes ?
yes , who is this ?
this is franois delambre speaking .
hlne ?
how are you , hlne dear ?
what can i do for you ?
franois ...
i' ve killed andr .
i need your help .
oh , now look , hlne .
it' s past midnight .
i' ve had a hard day .
i love you both dearly , but this sort ofjoke ...
it' s true .
i' ve killed andr .
you killed ?
but ...
please help me .
call the police and ...
come quickly !
i just can' t ...
hlne !
hlne ?
yes ?
monsieur franois ?
gaston .
i tried to call you .
something terrible has happened !
a man is dead .
his head is under the press !
and i saw a woman running ... running away !
yes , gaston .
it looked ...
i think it was madame delambre !
you stay there , gaston .
i' il get the police immediately .
atheneum club ?
is inspector charas still there ?
yes , thank you .
yes , i' il wait .
check .
sorry to interrupt , sir .
there is a call for you .
thank you .
hello .
inspector ?
this is franois delambre .
you may remember we met a few times at the club .
it' s just ...
i' m sorry to call you so late , but ...
well , i' m in terrible trouble .
trouble , monsieur ?
my sister in law just phoned .
she killed her husband , my brother , my brother andr .
what ?
at our factory , delambre frres .
and our night watchman called too .
there is a body .
where are you , mr delambre ?
i' il pick you up in a few minutes .
goodbye .
you' il have to excuse me .
hlne lives ...
no , we ought to look here first .
but i' ve got to talk to her .
i' ve sent a man .
she' il be all right .
it' s andr .
how can we raise the press ?
i' il do it for you .
would you like us to get one of your men ?
i' il be all right .
whenever you' re ready , monsieur .
dead about 30 minutes .
is the downstroke fast ?
no .
about the same .
no danger of it coming down again ?
no .
it' s been set for 50 tons .
impact zero .
zero ?
yes .
that means level with the bed .
it' s never been set that way .
never .
but that would squeeze the metal to nothing .
it' s been set for single strokes , too .
she didn' t know how to operate the press .
are you sure this is your brother ?
well , he ...
there was a long scar on his left leg , a war wound .
i' il ...
would you mind ?
doctor .
i can' t believe it .
can you think of a reason why she would do this ?
none .
absolutely none .
they were completely happy together .
they have a wonderful little boy , philippe , whom they both adore .
hlne was always so gentle .
it just doesn' t make sense .
his family and his work .
it' s impossible !
what is it , monsieur ?
the stroke count .
that' s the stroke count .
i don' t understand .
whoever did this to andr ...
it reads two .
they did it twice !
twice ?
oui , monsieur .
i heard the press come down two times .
evening , monsieur franois .
franois , mon ami .
is it true ?
yes .
mais c' est impossible .
did hlne ?
listen , i can' t believe it .
inspector , this is our family physician , dr ejoute .
inspector charas .
your man called me .
hlne told him , so i came .
how is she ?
quite calm now .
almost in a state of euphoria , of relief , as though she' s happy about it .
is she insane , doctor ?
hlne could never have killed her husband .
it' s impossible , unless she is or was insane .
did she tell you anything ?
nothing , except she killed him and how .
no , nothing in her could make her do that .
nothing .
why , inspector , i' ve known her all her life .
i even delivered her .
she and andr were devoted to each other .
where is madame delambre ?
in the living room .
franois , i' m sorry i called you .
as you see , i could have called the police myself .
i' m all right now .
hlne , if there' s anything i can do ...
you are the police ?
inspector charas , madame .
hlne , what' s going on ?
why do you say you killed andr ?
why ?
it' s all right , franois .
everything' s all right now .
madame , would you tell us what happened ?
of course , monsieur .
i killed my husband andr delambre about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed .
you understand the gravity of the crime .
you say you killed him .
that means you murdered him .
i killed andr , yes .
why ?
i cannot answer that question .
how did you kill him ?
with the hydraulic press .
how do you operate it ?
first you put on the main switch , then you set the stroke to whatever tonnage you want .
you set the stroke to maximum , that is level with the table , or zero .
then you press the release button .
it' s the red one .
you mean you put your husband under the press ?
no , inspector .
he did that himself .
he put his head and his arm under the press ?
yes .
why ?
i cannot answer that question .
coffee , inspector ?
yes , please .
gentlemen , would you wait for me outside ?
yes , of course .
no , thank you .
now , madame .
you were happy with your husband .
there were no mistresses .
i had no lovers .
we were both very happy .
that is the truth .
then why did you kill him ?
i wish to help you all i can , inspector .
but i cannot answer that question .
you pressed the button and it was all over .
yes .
why did you press it twice ?
oh , it was only once .
the stroke count read two .
a machine cannot lie .
oh , yes .
yes , it was twice .
i was wrong .
i did it twice .
why ?
perhaps you will wait , madame .
of course , inspector .
what would you advise medically , doctor ?
rest .
maybe in a day or two her state of mind will improve .
very well .
you understand the lady is under surveillance .
i' il arrange for one of our nurses to take charge of her .
thank you very much , inspector .
you can rely on me .
what do you think ?
would you show me your brother' s laboratory ?
yes , of course .
this way .
this is the work of a madman !
there was over $200, 000 worth of special equipment here .
andr was always so careful of everything .
special equipment ?
what was all this for ?
well , i don' t know .
it could have been anything , any one of a dozen ideas .
well , when he' d develop something , then he would show it to me .
he was working on an idea for the air ministry .
perhaps they' d know .
i imagine electronics is a profitable field these days .
yes , very .
we own the business jointly .
we both have more money than we know what to do with .
they had no outside interests , none , i' m sure of it .
that' s why it doesn' t make sense .
you' re very attached to both of them , aren' t you ?
yes .
inspector , what does all this mean ?
i' ve no idea .
she would tell me nothing except that she' d killed him .
there appears to be no motive , no reason , except insanity .
and even that leaves several important questions unanswered .
perhaps he committed suicide .
if he did , why does she say she killed him ?
and why such a clumsy method ?
and why involve your wife ?
and she was there .
she could hang for this .
poor philippe .
what will i tell him ?
how does one tell a child ?
well , if i may suggest , you could look after the boy for a while .
what' s going to happen to her ?
we' il keep her under observation .
there' s plenty of time .
did your brother ever experiment with animals ?
never .
or insects ?
insects ?
no .
though that would be funny , if ...
no .
hlne and andr believed in the sacredness of life .
they wouldn' t harm anything .
not even a fly .
lunch , madame .
oh , i' m eating much too much .
at this rate i' il gain pounds .
can i get up today ?
ask dr ejoute , madame .
every time i ask him , he says tomorrow .
you' re coming along nicely .
the rest will do you good .
is inspector charas coming today ?
he did not say , madame .
i like him .
he' s been very gentle .
i hope franois brings that nice little boy today .
what is his name ?
philippe ?
yes , philippe .
a nice boy .
they think i' m mad , don' t they ?
they never tell me what they think about .
go away .
go away !
is it bothering you ?
no .
no , it doesn' t bother me .
i' il soon rid you of the pest .
it' s all right .
please leave it alone !
but , nurse !
stop it , nurse .
stop it !
leave it alone !
leave it alone !
no !
no !
whatever ?
now you get back into bed .
let me look at the fly !
back into bed , madame .
get out of my way !
where is it ?
oh , there .
come on .
come on , madame .
it' s just a common housefly .
yes .
perhaps it symbolises something deep in her subconscious , as the psychiatrist believes .
mr delambre , do you think she' s mad ?
it' s obvious , isn' t it ?
in spite of what the doctors think , i believe mrs delambre' s mind is quite clear .
even when catching flies .
how can you say that ?
she must be mad .
what about philippe ?
she acts as if the boy were mine and not hers .
she may be trying to protect him .
perhaps she fears him , or even hates him .
that' s impossible .
hlne couldn' t hate anyone .
you must be out of your mind .
you' re in love with her , aren' t you ?
yes .
why didn' t you marry her ?
because she loved my brother .
i don' t think she ever noticed me .
i' m glad you' re being honest with me .
you see , at first i suspected you .
me ?
why should i do such a thing ?
motive one , for his wife .
motive two , to control delambre electronics .
what do i care about motives ?
hlne is in trouble and andr' s dead .
it' s a nightmare .
i know now you had nothing to do with it , but i had to check , for her sake .
i' m sorry , inspector .
i' m a fool .
you' ve been so patient .
forgive me .
it' s just ...
i understand , monsieur .
perhaps it' s i who should apologise .
i have to pry into all sorts of personal things .
it' s ...
well , it' s necessary , unfortunately .
thank you for coming .
if there' s anything i can do to help , i will .
did you discover what andr was working on ?
no .
the air ministry scientists have been through all his papers .
they didn' t mean a thing to them .
we couldn' t decipher the ashes .
nothing there either .
well , i' ve delayed all i can .
we' ve been quite patient with the lady .
i' m afraid i shall have to ask for a warrant tomorrow .
the courts can decide .
tomorrow ?
the charge can only be murder .
i' m sorry for you and the boy .
but i cannot conceive of any verdict except guilty , or guilty but insane .
thank you , yvette .
uncle ?
yes , philippe ?
when' s daddy coming home ?
soon .
can i see mummy again tomorrow ?
yes .
she' s very sick , isn' t she ?
yes , philippe , she' s very sick .
do flies live a long time ?
i don' t know .
why ?
because i saw that fly mummy was looking for again .
i didn' t know she was looking for one .
oh , yes , she was .
it' s grown quite a lot .
but i recognised it all right .
mm , this is good .
how did you recognise it , philippe ?
its head is white instead of black and it has a funny sort of leg .
it was on your desk this morning .
oh ?
i didn' t notice it .
when did you first see that fly , philippe ?
the day daddy went away .
i had caught it , but mummy made me let it go .
and then later , she wanted me to find it again .
she' d changed her mind .
you know how women are .
excuse me , philippe .
i won' t be a moment .
inspector charas .
inspector charas .
good evening , nurse .
why , mr delambre .
inspector charas told me about her relapse .
how is she now ?
resting quietly , poor lady .
but , monsieur ...
the inspector told me that i might speak to her for a few moments alone .
he knows i' m here .
but he didn' t say you were coming .
but he has so much on his mind .
i won' t be long .
franois , i didn' t hear you .
you look tired .
it' s just the office .
you know .
you shouldn' t work so hard .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
i feel all right .
i' m glad you came .
i wanted to ask you something .
of course , hlne .
anything at all .
how long do flies live ?
i don' t know .
i think a month , two months .
the fly you were looking for was in my study .
today .
did you kill it ?
no .
well , you have it with you .
give it to me .
please , give it to me !
hlne , i haven' t got it here .
you know now .
what is this all about ?
you haven' t got it or you wouldn' t ask .
yes , i have it .
it' s locked in my desk .
now tell me what happened .
no , never .
andr wouldn' t want me to .
i know you' re not mad .
i want the truth .
either you tell me or i' m going to give it to charas .
you swear you have it ?
yes .
if i tell you , will you promise to destroy it ?
i can' t do that until i know .
then i can' t tell you anything .
for your own sake you' ve got to tell me .
you' re all right or you can be all right , perhaps .
as soon as they examine it , they' il know .
and they' il know that you' re not insane .
no !
for philippe' s sake , franois , i beg you .
don' t you see ?
i was pretending to be mad , for philippe' s sake .
better i should be declared insane than he be the son of a woman hanged for murder .
i want to know .
either you tell me now , or i give the fly to charas .
if i tell you , will you tell them ?
i only want to help you .
i can only do that through them .
yes .
i would tell them .
poor franois .
call charas then .
i can' t tell it twice .
so long as you kill the fly .
you promise ?
yes .
this is not a confession .
although i killed my husband , i' m not a murderess .
i simply carried out his last wish .
a few months ago ...
who' s a ticklish boy ?
why not pick on somebody your own size ?
andr !
what a pleasant surprise .
hi , daddy .
are you gonna play with us ?
later , philippe .
i' ve got to borrow your mother for a moment .
i won' t be long , i promise .
i tell you what .
before you go to bed , i' il play with you .
promise ?
promise .
all right , then .
i' il play with dandelo .
good .
be gentle with her , philippe .
come on .
i' ve got to show you something .
andr !
we don' t see you for days on end ...
now don' t argue with me .
come on .
but ...
i' d no idea you' d made so many changes .
a completely new line of research .
let me guess .
the permanent battery .
not the portable reactor ?
i' il show you .
but there must be no mention of this made to anyone .
of course .
it' s much too important .
hlne , you' re the first to see a miracle .
remember this ?
of course .
our wedding present from my devoted and very rich aunt bess .
the family heirloom .
hurry .
put them on .
now watch the box .
you can take your goggles off now , darling .
it' s gone .
come on .
it' s the same one .
have you turned magician ?
in a way .
for a split second , an infinitesimal part of a second , this was disintegrated .
for one little moment it no longer existed .
only atoms travelling through space at the speed of light .
then a moment later integrated again into the shape of an ashtray .
oh , you' re joking !
doesn' t sound possible , does it ?
but it is true .
it is impossible .
you' re playing some joke on me .
take television .
what happens ?
a stream of electrons sound and picture impulses are transmitted through the air .
the tv camera is the disintegrator .
your set unscrambles or integrates the electrons back into pictures and sound .
yes , but this is different .
why ?
well , because it' s impossible .
fifty years ago , if my father were told he could sit in montreal and watch a world series in new york as it happened , he' d say it was impossible .
this is the same principle exactly .
but it' s not the same .
this is solid .
no , it' s not .
to your touch maybe it is .
but in reality it' s billions of atoms , which we believe are only a series of electrical impulses .
you actually did this ?
it' s no trick ?
no .
i can transport matter anything at the speed of light , perfectly .
of course this is only a crude beginning .
but i' ve stumbled on the most important discovery since man sawed off the end of a tree trunk and found the wheel .
the disintegrator integrator will change life as we know it .
think what it means .
anything , even humans , will go through one of these devices .
no need for cars or railways or airplanes , even spaceships .
we' il set up matter receiving stations throughout the world , and later the universe .
there' il never be famine .
surpluses can be sent instantaneously at almost no cost , anywhere .
humanity need never want or fear again .
i' m a very fortunate man , hlne .
i' m a very fortunate woman .
don' t ever transmit me .
i wouldn' t want to come out like this .
what do you mean ?
well , it doesn' t matter , does it , andr ?
andr ...
it' s perfect .
everything checks .
it' s perfect .
perfect .
dandelo !
what' s the matter ?
are you hungry ?
there we are .
that' s it .
you won' t feel a thing , dandelo .
and tomorrow you' il be the most famous cat in all the world .
dandelo !
dandelo ...
hello ?
franois , how nice to hear you .
important ?
you' re getting married .
no .
no , not yet .
no , i think i like it this way .
no , it' s just that ...
well , there' s no hurry .
is andr there ?
andr ?
i' ve seen him about two hours in the last two weeks .
he eats and sleeps in his lab .
he won' t even answer the telephone .
i don' t want to eat !
i don' t want to hear one more word .
you' re going to eat your dinner right now !
i don' t want to eat !
philippe' s delinquent , dandelo' s disappeared , i' ve got to go to professor augier' s alone .
you know how he is , hlne .
it' s just until he solves his problem , whatever it is .
be patient .
how you men stick together .
anything i can do ?
ok , franois .
i' il tell him if i see him .
i' ve got to run now , franois .
bye .
well !
where have you been ?
listen , darling .
i' m sorry about the last couple of weeks .
i had a little setback , but it' s all right now .
i didn' t mind .
well , maybe just a little .
call augier and cancel .
we' il celebrate by ourselves .
wonderful !
i didn' t want to go anyway .
oh , franois called about some equipment .
he' s sending it over .
good .
by the time you' ve changed , i' il be ready .
changed ?
i' ve got tickets for the ballet .
the ballet ?
and we' il eat at tour d' eiffel .
wonderful !
now hurry .
we' il finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne .
finish ?
well , not quite .
oh ?
what , then ?
well , what do you suggest ?
you' re in an unscientific mood .
you don' t approve ?
i didn' t say that .
will the champagne be as good as ever ?
exactly the same , bubble for bubble .
here .
the label' s perfect !
of course .
and it' s still cold .
and it' il stay that way , until i show you something else .
no , andr , don' t .
it might not work .
i won' t allow it !
it' il be all right .
andr , please !
put your goggles on , darling .
it' s astounding !
it works !
i test ran it this morning .
it' s all right .
you' ve succeeded completely !
it' s unbelievable !
we' il have to wait and see .
i' il know in a few weeks .
i don' t understand .
i have to see if it suffers from any ill effects .
if it' s alive in , say , a month , we' il pronounce the experiment successful .
may i look after him ?
it' s still a her .
but you can .
for one whole month she' s mine .
now don' t kill her with overfeeding .
it' s a little frightening , isn' t it ?
yes .
the first live experiment was disastrous .
dandelo .
dandelo !
andr , how could you !
she disintegrated perfectly but never reappeared .
i don' t know why , even now .
i redesigned the projecting device , and now it' s perfect .
well , where' s she gone ?
into space .
a stream of cat atoms .
it would be funny if life weren' t so sacred .
andr , promise me one thing .
no more experiments with animals .
i promise you .
no more experiments with animals .
it' s frightening .
it' s like playing god .
god gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature .
without the gift , nothing is possible .
andr , i get so scared sometimes .
the suddenness of our age .
electronics , rockets , earth satellites , supersonic flight , and now this .
it' s not so much who invents them .
it' s the fact they exist .
but you' re not frightened of tv , or radio , or x rays , or electricity , or that the earth is round .
no , but everything' s going so fast .
i' m just not ready to take it all in .
it' s all so quick .
just do like philippe does .
accept them as part of our normal life .
they' re facts .
wonderful facts .
which brings me back to the champagne .
i love you so much , andr .
it' s wonderful being married to you .
and to you , my love .
you' re the healthiest guinea pig in the whole world .
andr !
you' il catch cold .
not today .
what are you doing ?
oh , just looking at the sky .
looking at god , perhaps .
you' re a strange man , andr .
so precise and practical , and yet so ...
i don' t quite know how to put it .
so aware of the infinite ?
the more i know , the more sure i am i know so little .
the eternal paradox .
you said you were frightened by progress .
i' m filled with the wonder of it .
spring will soon be here .
i like spring the best .
all life growing , renewing itself .
it' s fantastic to be alive .
how do you mean ?
i don' t know .
it' s just ...
i' m just so happy to be alive , that' s all .
so am i.
would you marry me again if you had your time over ?
i think so .
well , i' ve got a lot to do .
franois is coming to lunch .
bring him to the lab .
we' il show him now .
shall i call professor augier and the air ministry ?
no .
there' s no hurry .
i don' t even know how or why parts of it work yet .
it' s too important .
it' s too impossible .
poor franois .
he' il never believe it .
don' t stay out too long , darling .
you look tired .
the last thing i am is tired .
and we' re finishing with crpes suzette .
what' s all the celebration about ?
andr wants to show you something .
in the lab ?
well , what is it ?
flat screen ?
it' s better .
no more questions .
come on .
i' ve only been into the laboratory three times .
each time i came out with a potential fortune .
oh , dear .
we won' t see him for lunch .
i see what you mean .
his writing gets worse and worse .
mummy !
mummy !
where are you ?
coming , philippe .
yes , darling ?
i got something to show you .
i have something to show you .
i caught such a funny iooking fly .
you want to see it ?
you know how your father disapproves of you catching insects .
but this isn' t like any other fly i' ve ever seen .
it has a funny white head and sort of white leg .
now you let it go at once .
now go along , do as you' re told .
go on .
look at all that dirt you' ve brought in .
best fly i ever caught .
anything else , madame ?
no , thank you , emma .
good night .
shall i leave something for the master ?
he didn' t touch a bite of his dinner .
i fetched up his tray about an hour ago .
it was still outside the door .
had his favourite pastry on it too .
he probably didn' t hear you knock .
i' il see if he wants anything .
thank you .
good night , madame .
good night , emma .
andr ?
andr , i' m going to bed now .
is there anything you want ?
andr .
hlne , i' ve had some trouble .
trouble ?
andr , what' s the matter ?
answer me .
i' m counting on you not to lose your nerve , for only you can help me .
i' ve had a serious accident , but i' m not in danger at the moment , although it' s a matter of life or death .
andr !
it' s no good calling to me or saying anything .
i can' t answer .
i can' t speak .
you' ve got to do exactly and very carefully what i tell you .
knock three times to show you understand , then fetch me a bowl of milk laced with rum .
bowl of milk ?
andr !
anything i can do , madame ?
no , i can manage .
go back to bed , emma .
good night , madame .
when you knock , i' il open the door .
walk over to my desk and put the milk on it .
then go into the other lab and try to find a fly .
a fly .
you will easily recognise it .
its head is white .
philippe .
oh , andr .
don' t hurt it , just give it to me .
before you come in , you must promise to obey me implicitly .
do not look at me .
talking is useless .
i cannot answer .
knock three times to show i have your promise .
my life is in your hands .
you can depend on me , darling .
it' s not in here .
if you can' t talk , knock .
knock once for yes and twice for no .
do you understand ?
we' il find the fly tomorrow , i promise .
just as soon as it' s light i' il start looking .
now why don' t you go to bed ?
i' il help you .
no one will see you , i promise .
philippe caught a fly this morning .
he said its head was white .
i didn' t see it .
i made him let it go .
come back in morning .
will type explanation .
need you fresh and strong tomorrow .
poor darling .
sorry .
i' m all right now , darling .
don' t worry .
i' il find that fly .
do you need anything tonight ?
darling , please try and get some sleep .
good night , darling .
andr ?
remember the ashtray ?
i' ve had a similar accident .
i transmitted myself successfully yesterday .
but in a second experiment , a fly which i did not notice was in the disintegrator with me .
when we reintegrated our atoms were mixed .
now my only hope is to find the fly , go through the machine once more with it , and pray our atoms untangle .
if you can' t find it , i' il have to destroy myself .
can i come back in ?
don' t worry , andr .
i' il find that fly .
it can' t be far away .
but you mustn' t talk about destroying yourself .
you mustn' t !
i' il call professor augier and other scientists .
they can help you .
don' t be angry , andr .
i only thought that ...
promise me that you won' t do anything .
let me see your face .
i won' t be afraid .
all right .
all right , andr .
all right .
flies , madame ?
yes .
close the windows .
catch flies ?
i told you , emma .
a fly escaped from the lab .
we' ve got to find it .
it' s got a white head .
mummy !
i don' t know what' s gotten into this house .
mummy !
look !
caught lots of ' em .
where is it ?
are you sure you caught it ?
oh , the white one .
no , i haven' t caught it yet .
i told you to find that fly !
i' m sorry , philippe darling .
but you' ve got to find it .
the white one .
only the white one .
gotcha !
you fool !
i said catch them .
don' t kill them .
i' m sorry , emma .
please , just catch them .
madame !
there' s one in the hall .
where ?
where is it ?
oh , it' s no good , emma .
we' il never find it .
philippe ?
make some supper , emma , would you ?
i' m sorry .
it' s just that ...
come on , philippe .
go and wash for dinner , there' s a good boy .
all right , mummy .
oh , philippe .
i see it !
don' t move .
go and get some sugar , quick !
give me the sugar .
and close those doors .
now stay back .
caught him !
good boy , philippe !
careful now .
oh , no .
it' s in back of the curtain !
don' t harm it .
don' t hurt it .
oh , god , don' t let it get out .
you try and keep it behind the curtain .
i' il get it from outside .
oh , no .
oh , god !
please , god , don' t let it ...
don' t cry , mummy .
please don' t cry .
we' il catch it tomorrow .
don' t worry .
please don' t worry .
andr ?
we caught the fly today , but it escaped out into the garden .
i' il look for it again tomorrow .
you eat .
i' il read this here .
if you had caught the fly , you would not be reading this .
i know you will never catch it now .
it' s hopeless .
there are things man should never experiment with .
now i must destroy everything , all evidence , even myself .
no one must ever know what i discovered .
it' s too dangerous .
i' ve thought of a way .
it' s not easy , but i need your help .
andr !
you can still reason , andr .
you' ve got no right to destroy yourself .
you mustn' t think about it .
you' ve still got your intelligence .
you' re still a man with a soul .
you' ve no right to destroy yourself !
we' il find that fly tomorrow .
i know we will .
think easy .
but you' ve got to give me more time .
why ?
why won' t you wait ?
then see augier and the other scientists .
they' il do anything to help you !
i' ve another idea .
remember the ashtray experiment ?
go through again .
it worked before .
why ?
please try it .
you' ve got to try it .
please , andr .
for my sake .
maybe it will work .
i beg you !
darling , i love you and i want you so much .
please , please let this come out right .
hurry , darling .
it will work .
it has worked , hasn' t it ?
you' il be all right now .
i know it' s worked !
no !
no !
no !
a strange story , mrs delambre .
it' s almost impossible to believe , isn' t it ?
where are his notes ?
he destroyed them .
and the writing on the blackboard ?
i rubbed it out .
i see .
well , i must be going .
thank you for telling me .
inspector , it wasn' t wrong to destroy the thing .
a fly headed human ?
no .
it wasn' t andr .
i couldn' t have hurt andr .
but i' m glad .
i' m glad the thing is dead .
i' il see you out , inspector .
inspector ...
i' il be with you in a moment .
inspector .
do you believe the story ?
well , it explains all the facts .
the reason for the press , the fly , everything .
true .
but i asked you if you believed it .
oh , i' m only a policeman , i' m not a science fiction enthusiast .
but i do not believe what she said .
it can' t happen .
but you don' t ...
well , i mean , you didn' t know andr .
he was a genius in some ways .
possibly .
but matter cannot be transmitted .
the story is impossible !
i' il be back at ten with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder .
the nurse is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason .
but , inspector , it might be the truth .
it is the truth to her .
i' m satisfied now she' s insane .
don' t worry .
she won' t hang .
well , i' m not satisfied .
i wish i could help you .
the lady' s in need of a doctor' s care , permanently .
there' s no telling whom she might attack next .
perhaps the boy .
but there must be something we can do to prove ...
there is .
show me the fly .
good morning , monsieur .
good morning , emma .
how' s the mistress , sir ?
as well as can be expected .
such a lovely lady .
yes .
emma , when you had that mad search for a fly , did you see it ?
oh , yes .
i saw it .
what did it look like ?
oh , just a fly .
i' d say it was a bluebottle .
you know , quite a large one .
but did it look any different ?
not to me it didn' t .
she and philippe were saying its head was white .
but it was just a fly .
thank you .
may i fix you breakfast , sir ?
a nice cup of tea ?
some coffee ?
no , thank you .
help !
help me !
help me !
help !
help me !
please help me !
help me !
we can manage , thank you , mr delambre .
well , i thought i ought to be here .
you wish to check the warrant ?
as next of kin you have the right .
no , i' m sure it must be all right .
madame ?
time to get up now .
i slept so well .
wonderfully .
is it a nice day ?
yes .
i think i' il have the silk one .
take this one .
you must be warm .
but i' m not going out .
come in .
good morning , mrs delambre .
inspector .
but i don' t understand .
i have a warrant for your arrest for murder .
and i must caution you , anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence .
but , inspector , i told you everything .
it is for the court to decide .
but you said it was not wrong to kill a thing .
you have to come with us , madame .
franois , didn' t you show them ?
you didn' t destroy it ?
inspector , you saw it .
i' m afraid i did not , mrs delambre .
i lied to you , hlne .
i never had it .
i never had it .
you never had it ?
if you' il just come with us , madame .
you never saw it ?
leave her alone .
she doesn' t have to go with you .
i demand that i have time to talk to my attorney .
dr ejoute will care for her .
i have consulted him .
the patient is ready to leave .
i don' t believe it .
i have his diagnosis and his authority .
no , wait .
wait !
don' t make things more difficult , monsieur .
here you go , ma' am .
you' il be all right .
no , franois .
don' t let them take me !
don' t let them lock me up !
franois , please !
mummy !
philippe .
franois , do something .
don' t let him see me like this !
please !
philippe .
you can' t see her , philippe .
not at the moment .
i' il take you for a walk .
i know .
i' il take you to the movies .
but they don' t open till this afternoon .
well , then i' il take you this afternoon .
is the ambulance for mummy ?
yes .
is she going to be all right ?
yes .
all right .
i ran all the way over here .
i wanted to see how she was .
i wanted her to play with me .
she' d like that , philippe .
but she can' t , not now .
when' s daddy coming home then ?
soon , philippe .
i saw that funny iooking fly again .
which show will we go to ?
any ...
you saw the fly ?
where ?
it' s in a web .
the spider' s going to get it .
by the bench in the garden .
you' re sure ?
oh , yes .
stay here a minute .
inspector , it' s in the garden !
please , monsieur .
philippe has seen it !
it' s there .
i beg of you , please .
please !
all right .
show me where .
here , uncle franois .
wait in the house .
there' s a good boy , philippe .
help me !
please help me !
help !
go away !
no !
please help me !
please go away !
go away !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
charas !
i didn' t believe it .
but you saw it .
you saw it , didn' t you ?
yes , i saw it .
i thought she was ...
as god is my witness , i saw the thing .
it' s unbelievable .
i shall never forget that scream as long as i live .
you' ve committed murder just as much as hlne did .
you killed a fly with a human head .
she killed a human with a fly head .
if she murdered , so did you .
i know .
but who' s going to believe us ?
they' il think we' re both mad .
but he could have started the press and got under it in time .
it could have been suicide .
andr' s mind was deranged .
hlne just tried to stop him .
but the stroke count .
i was the one who forgot to reset it , after it was used the last time .
yes .
yes .
it could have been suicide .
a great shot , philippe .
franois .
hello .
you look wonderful .
thank you .
hi , uncle franois .
you taking me to the zoo ?
yes , if your mother doesn' t ...
you run along .
we' il have dinner together later .
oh , good .
uncle ?
yes ?
mummy told me about daddy .
something she said to ask you .
why did he die ?
well , philippe , he died because of his work .
he was like an explorer in a wild country where no one had ever been before .
he was searching for the truth .
he almost found a great truth .
but for one instant he was careless .
that' s what killed him ?
search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world .
and the most dangerous .
i' d like that .
i' d like to be an explorer like him .
will you help me , uncle franois ?
yes , philippe .
you' d better run and get a coat .
yes .
right away .
you' re a dear one , franois .
so kind and thoughtful .
thank you .
here i am .
well , come along , you two .
i' il see you off .
