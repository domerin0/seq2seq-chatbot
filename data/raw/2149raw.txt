they played it this morning .
this morning ?
yes at 5 . 15 when we' re leaving for work .
it was so nice .
come on , play it once more .
they play it when we' re asleep or when we' re out ...
where is my comb ?
where did i put it ?
don' t come here boss we' re changing .
i' ve seen hundreds of bodies like yours !
not like mine !
he' s used to his fancy bit .
she' s got a big arse .
and he' s got a big gut !
but that' s all i' ve got left !
listen , there' s a new trainee starting today , so watch your language in front of him !
i know your big mouths !
what do you take us for , boss .
has anyone seen this trainee , girls ?
no .
i wonder what he looks like .
i bet he' s just a kid !
he' s only 16 if he is an apprentice .
nothing for us then .
don' t worry peter , you' il soon learn , don' t worry .
we are a self service store .
i' il tell you exactly how it works .
we have complete faith in our customers , we do believe them , in 100 % , you know .
but of course some of them will still from time to time steal something .
your job will be to keep an eye on our customers , and have your wits about you .
but they can' t know that you are watching .
they mustrt know you' re watching them .
nothing wrong in that !
you' re just preventing those customers from stealing .
we' re simply educating them !
look peter , i' ve never caught anyone while wearing a white coat ...
if the customer sees that coat , he knows you' re part of the collective , so he' s careful ... he' s careful .
but without the coat you' d catch one or two magpies .
may i put it here ?
of course you can , peter .
understand , peter ?
so , okay .
yes .
peter , like i said already , this is not the way to do it .
you' re tailing these people like a cop .
you peek in their bags .
they are not going to put anything they steal on top .
easy does it and be inconspicuous , do you understand ?
i do .
so try it once again .
excuse me , i had a feeling that the man has just stolen something .
which one ?
he' s outside already .
so run after him , hurry up .
but i' m not sure that he has ...
it doesn' t matter , go on .
where have you been ?
where have you been ?
at work .
at work ?
yes .
i really was at work .
where ?
at the shop , where else ...
do you know your boss ?
of course .
so what was he doing here , looking for you ?
i guess he doesn' t know you then .
of course he does but something happened .
what ?
i had the feeling one man stole something .
so i followed him .
i see ...
you were being a detective .
so you thought he' d stolen something .
so what did you do ?
then i followed him around .
and that was all ?
yeah .
what was the point of following him around ?
did you identify him ?
did you see what he took ?
no i didn' t .
and what would you' ve done ?
i just followed him .
what would i' ve done ?
i' d call somebody .
to stop and identify the man .
and search him .
but just to follow him around that makes no sense !
i tought he' d give himself away .
but how .
why didn' t you get his name ?
you can' t do that .
why not ?
i' d call a policeman or someone older and get his name .
you had the feeling he' d shoplifted .
yeah , but i wasrt sure .
then you should have stayed in the shop .
i couldn' t .
i told about to our women and they said to follow him .
so i did .
why didn' t you tell your boss ?
what' s the point to tell some women .
i mean the sales ladies .
i see .
so what was the final consequence , the final result ?
nothing .
i just followed him all day .
you followed him .
so you werert at work ?
but i was .
just for a while .
and what did you do after that ?
so tell me .
just answer .
i went home .
did you ?
so , you went home .
a bit early !
werert you supposed to go back ?
why home ?
how you dare ?
or do you think everybody can just up and leave his job and go home ?
there were many things in my life i didn' t like .
but i had to face them , often against my will .
that' s what made a man out of me .
that was that !
come on , dad , let it be .
peter is still a kid .
i' m not some little kid .
of course not !
and you should have realized that a long time ago !
here , let me warm it up for you .
forget it .
but it' s cold .
it' s alright .
it' s not !
warm it up .
if you look around these shops nowadays , what do you see ?
nothing but women .
no men ... they' re as rare as goldust .
and in the end , what are the women good for ?
they get married and the workplace is empty .
so who does it all depend on ?
who stayed then ?
men !
men .
put up with it for a year or two ... and then you' il be the boss .
you know what that means ?
you' il be somebody !
it' s just up to you ... to become that boss early !
god forbid there wont ' be another war .
as the saying goes ...
stay near the food to keep far from the grave .
but don' t think about that .
don' t think about that at all .
look .
on monday , you' il go back to work and apologize and everything will be allright .
understand ?
do you understand ?
when we were twenty you wanted my love
i was getting married but you went to the army .
when we were twenty you wanted my love
i was getting married ... ... or if there was a fire at least .
so you could go and put it out .
no , they' ve got plenty of firemen already .
don' t look at me .
see , i' d just be saving lives if the fire was at night .
at night ?
we' d haul the women out of their beds !
oh , yeah !
sure !
lmagine the flames licking pavla .
lucky flames .
see , now i pushed out all the air .
all the air pushed out .
but if my chest is up like this ...
it' s like you expect what a girl wants to say ... and she' s just got her breasts like this ...
how are pavla' s breasts ?
i don' t know .
only mara knows , huh .
i don' t know why she' s going out with him .
he thinks he' s so cool , but he' s a bad influence on her .
i met them for many times walking by the river .
they go ... she goes ...
i' m standing there looking at her and she doesn' t even glance at me .
i get the feeling i am not there .
but you are , you are .
i know .
you are a virgin .
yeah , yeah .
tell me , oh lovely maiden ...
a little higher !
why do you laugh ?
not everybody can sing like you .
do you know that ?
it' s a parody of othello .
yeah .
now he leaves ...
my sweet othello , i love you so .
oh , my sweet othello , i do love you .
i declare my love for you !
i can' t hear you .
louder !
oh , my sweet othello , i love you so .
now casio comes in ...
what ?
who ?
you never saw it ?
no , did you ?
i did .
good evening , my lovely lady , sorry to disturb you .
othello is to report to court immediately ...
othello is to come immediately ... cause two guards are fighting over their posts .
and he says goodbye to her and leaves .
now casio is alone with her ... and he says ...
i can' t remember what he says , though .
listen .
what ?
that isn' t a very good song .
wait a little .
how does it go ?
peter !
is peter here ?
is he not here ?
peter !
seems he is not here .
and it goes on .
your husband , my lady , is a great hero , and he loves you faithfully ...
what are you looking at ?
i' m not looking , i' m thinking .
about what ?
i can' t tell you .
why not ?
you' d think i had a dirty mind .
i already know that !
what ?
not really .
what are you thinking about ?
i really can' t say .
i know it anyway .
so say it .
i can' t .
come on , say it .
actually , there' s nothing dirty about that , you know .
some girls wear swimsuits even tinier than mine .
and some little girls walk around totally naked .
true , but only the little ones .
yeah .
i really hate the girls who show off and then ...
come on , row !
go ahead and row !
i am rowing !
i can' t see !
those girls are in my class .
what about those guys ?
i don' t know them .
some bums ...
get lost !
this is not a show .
her hair was all locks and curls ...
no !
that' s wrong .
her hair was all she ever thought about .
stop , i beg you !
don' t ' beg me .
it' s like this ...
her hair was all locks and curls ...
when she stood by ...
but sing it all . ... by a window ...
her hair was all locks and curls ...
she didn' t think about anything else .
so , do sing .
what are you looking at ?
the grass .
why the grass ?
green colour soothes the eyes .
that' s why the cows are so calm ?
sorry ...
i didn' t mean it that way .
you bull .
look , those boys are staring at us .
so let them .
if i were them , i' d never run around in my boxers .
you can' t help the way you look .
could you go out with them ?

it' s quite interesting .
it' s about a boy like you .
they don' t give him a name , that' s not done anymore ...
but ...
but it' s all true .
you can read it yourself .
it' s something like ...
you' re a man now , so you' il work it all out .
just read it !
i know it .
i read it already .
good night .
what every boy should know about his body

maybe jan hus or jan zizka .
i told you this is for the shop .
i see .
what was on saturday ?
i got a bit drunk .
bullshit .
it' s true .
and what about her ?
mara was there and ...
and what ?
i got a date with her for today .
what time did you get home ?
at about eleven .
and what did you do ?
what ... all kinds of things .
and the tongue is a problem , eh ?
well , yeah .
don' t tell me you two kissed .
i' ve got a date with her today .
what about the sell by date on these ?
i hope they' re still allright .
and these oils here ?
they have three more weeks to go .
good .
and these ?
this is the latest delivery .
these should be completely fresh .
yes .
and they actually are .
good , it' s good .
peter , what are you doing ?
get the stuff in and shut the door !
now the cooking fats .
they are all fresh .
that' s the last delivery , it' s fresh .
thank you .
that' s okay .
i' ve seen them .
now the rum .
two , four ... sixteen , eighteen bottles .
it says twenty one here .
that' s yesterday' s count .
so we' ve sold three since then .
here we' ve got the five star brand .
what are you doing !
don' t be lazy !
don' t cut that rope !
untie it !
we can always use rope !
so how many five stars ?
two , four , six .
yes , six , that' s fine .
and the pure spirits .
two , four , six , eight , ten .
ten , yes .
boss , please ...
that' s fine , peter , that' s fine .

bitter herb .
two , four , six ... nine .
yes .

a painting has to be viewed from the distance .
i don' t have the right glasses ...
good lord , it' s beautiful .
look at her eyes , they' re closed .
but she knows what she' s doing .
make a little funnel , so those bottles stop distracting you .
look at where she has that hand !
no , no , that' s perfectly normal .
look at the kid , look at him .
save a little bit for tomorrow !
what are you looking at ?
if the women could go shopping naked , our hiring troubles would be over .
and you know it' s a serious problem .
you can count the boys willing to work in a shop on your fingers .
they all want to be astronauts , engineers ...
and when we do get a man in here , he' s surly defective .
let' s go on to the wine .
all right .
so here is the sylvaner green .
two , four , six ... ten .
agreed .
then mostar .
three , six , nine ... eighteen .
that' s right .
what did you have in the can' t near the train station today ?
i was carrying some paintings .
what you mean ?
what paintings ?
for the boss .
you see , for the boss , paintings .
who can buy paintings nowadays ?
come on , dad ...
they were not really paintings .
they were more like prints ...
prints , prints .
it was a reward from headquarters .
you see , a reward .
well , reward .
what was on those paintings ?
i did ask you a question .
answer me .
awoman .
awoman ...
what kind of a woman ?
damn it , answer me .
i asked you a question .
i have to pry every word out of you .
completely naked .
peter !
aha , naked .
you see , dear .
they all talk about socialism and then they use our boy to deliver filth !
you should talk to them .
my god !
what' s so horrible about seeing a naked woman ?
after all , he is a big boy now , he can see things like that .
you should be ashamed .
and you too .
you' re saying it was obscene .
actually she was a thousand times prettier than the one we have .
don' t be impudent .
take a look .
just take a look .
look at her eyes .
that' s what i call beauty !
you walk this way , she' s following you .
walk that way , she' s following you again .
what a beauty !
i' d like to see somebody paint like that these days !
it' s all scribbling , now .
goodbye .
isn' t pavla going out with mara ?
she used to ...
hello .
hello .
so say something .
like what ?
well , something .
nothing comes to mind right now ...
what were you looking at ?
let me see .
it' s just a poster .
let me see it .
it isn' t a poster really .
what it was ?
it' s more like a painting .
so let me see it .
i can' t .
just let me see .
i really can' t .
where shall we go ?
okay so keep it .
where shall we go ?
nowhere .
so , here it is .
you' ve got it upside down .
where did you get it ?
in our shop .
why is it so crumpled ?
shame .
because i had it in my pocket .
how old do you think she is ?
it' s hard to say with women .
i mean with paintings .
she' s definitely older than nine .
that' s for sure .
it' s nice .
shame it' s crumpled .
i' d really love it if you could find time again tomorrow .
but when i get home now my mum will be angry of me being late , and i won' t even be able to ask her .
i know just what you mean .
you can' t imagine the hell i go through at home .
why ?
well , just a hell .
my mum constantly wants me to tell her everything .
she even says i don' t love her .
i do , but if i tell her that , she starts all over again .
and dad says i' il be the death of her ...
and she is so naive .
please , darling , don' t drown there .
that' s really horrible .
sonny , say hello to everybody !
it' s like i don' t know how to behave .
or she tells me i like other people more than her .
like who ?
like my friend lada , for example .
i must leave , you can tell me some other time , okay ?
then you' il come tomorrow .
i don' t know yet .
i' il be there anyway , just in case .
bye now .
bye .
peter !
my mum wants to know if they have gherkins at your shop .
thanks .
see you !
what is it ?
what are you doing ?
you' re just standing there and ...
it' s embarrassing .
you' re gaping like a dummy .
i' m just doing my job .
you call this working ?
i' ve been watching you and it' s not a pretty sight .
doing what ?
well , i' m here watching .
that' s not work !
just to stand and watch .
what are you watching ?
the people , obviously .
obviously , but why ?
so they don' t steal something .
that' s all right , then .
keep your eyes open .
sadly , there are still people with sticky fingers around here .
boss !
that' s correct , really .
boss !
what is it , peter ?
he' s back , he' s here again .
and who ?
well , the one that i was chasing and he got away .
call me later , please .
a bit later , will you ?
just wait a little .
wait .
has anything happened ?
nothing .
some woman stole something .
what ?
awoman ?
what did she steal ?
some sweets , or something .
nothing much .
worth about how much ?
twelve crowns maybe .
it was not more .
did you go after her ?
i did not .
so what did you do then ?
nothing .
you didn' t even follow her outside ?
