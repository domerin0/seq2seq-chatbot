excuse me , but aren' t you sarah morton ?
it is you .
i recognize you .
look , i' m reading your latest novel .
i love it .
i' m a big fan of inspector dorwell .
i' ve read all your books
you must have mistaken me with someone else .
i' m not the person you think i am .
excuse me .
**** [ rock ]
excuse me .
good morning .
what would you like ?
whiskey , please .
ice ?
yes .
yeah . and after that in all the directories .
and we will renew . most definitely . that shouldn' t be a problem .
just a minute .
hello , sarah .
how are you ?
could be better .
is john in ?
yes , but he' s in a meeting .
who with ?
terry long .
who ?
uh, just
yeah .
i' m in the process of drawing up the contract now and it should be with you shortly .
yeah , i' m absolutely sure .
now , you' re on what' s called " a roll .
you must keep the momentum going .
take a short holiday , but nothing too long . sarah .
um , let me introduce you . sarah morton , terry long .
terry long , sarah morton .
i' m so pleased to meet you . my mother adores you . she' s read all your dorwell books .
right .
well , terry , always a pleasure .
we' il speak very soon .
and congratulations again on that award .
i' m sure it' s the first of many .
oh , geez, john .
very nice to have met you .
and do hurry . my mother' s impatiently awaiting the arrival of the newest inspector dorwell book .
so what award did that little shit get ?
the manchester book critics .
hardly the booker prize , i know , but it' s not bad for a first novel .
the " little shit , " as you call him , has talent .
i just hope he sells .
i trust you taught him your favorite motto .
and what motto' s that ?
you know damn well .
you drilled it into me 20 years ago .
awards are like hemorrhoids . sooner or later every asshole gets one .
did i say that ?
my god , you' re jealous , aren' t you ?
you don' t look after me anymore .
j ust because i g ive a little fl ed g lin g some encoura g ement does not mean that i am ne g lectin g you .
besides , you' ve never had any problems finding inspiration for the dorwell series .
you write with such remarkable ease i wonder you need me at all .
okay , sarah , what' s the matter ?
c an' t be money .
you' re rollin g in it .
it' s incredible .
the only thing you can find to talk about to me is money .
i don' t g ive a damn about money ... or success !
i just want to find  an inspiring plot .
n o .
you don' t understand .
it' s it' s got nothing to do with inspiration .
i' m i' m fed up with murders ... and investi g ations .
why don' t you confound your critics and write something completely different ?
put dorwell on the shelf , as it were .
you didn' t like the last one , did you ?
i knew it !
and you haven' t had the balls to tell me .
that' s simply not true .
you know very well i' ve loved the dorwell series right from the beginning .
as well you might ... considering the money they make you .
do you like france ?
i like frogs ' legs .
s o what ? my house .
why don' t you go there for a while , hmm ?
breathe some fresh air .
it' s free , it' s out of season , the weather' s glorious .
there' s a swimming pool .
would you come and visit me ?
well .
i have g ot my dau g hter .
b ut maybe i ' il come f or a weekend .
are you marcel ?
yes .
hello , i' m sarah morton .
how was your trip ?
very nice . may i carry this ?
it' s on wheels .
i' il take the small one .
thank you . my car is just outside .
okay .
the bedrooms and bath are upstairs , the kitchen' s on the left .
i' il let you take a look around .
i turned on the hot water and gas .
if you need anything , you' ve got my number ?
yes, john gave it to me .
good .
to go to the village , you can take the footpath i showed you ... or use the moped in the garage .
the keys are in the ignition .
thank you , marcel .
good bye .
good bye , madame .
enjoy your rest .
b on j our .
b on j our .

hello ?

john , how are you ?
i' m very well .
i should be asking you that question .
so , tell me , how' s everything going , darling ?
did marcel come and fetch you ?
yes , but listen .
i have just one thing to say to you , and that' s thank you .
you were right , as usual .
your house is a little piece of paradise .
and i' ve already begun working .
hmm ? so soon ?
yes .
the idea kept running through my mind while i was on the train .
you know , one of those stupid things that just latch on and won' t let go .
really ?
i don' t know where it' s heading , but so , what' s dorwell up to now ?
well , i' m not ready to talk about it right now .
all right .
but i think it might be quite funny .
anyway , i' m going to wait until i' m sure .
well , that' s marvelous .
well , i' m glad you' re happy .
have you been out and about yet ?
no .
i' m just enjoying the peace and quiet here .
good .
yeah . so , when are you thinking of coming ?
um , i don' t know .
i' m not sure .
it it depends on the work , you know .
um , look , i' m sorry , sweetheart .
i' ve got another call coming through .
now , you take care , and call me when you' re ready to read me something , all right ?
right .
fine .
good bye, john .
you scared me !
who are you ?
what are you doing in my house ?
your house ?
this is my house !
i should be asking you .

that' s correct .
i' m sarah morton .
i' m a writer .
and my publisher, john bosload , is letting me this house .
ah . so you' re daddy' s latest conquest .
you' re his daughter ? so what ?
didn' t he warn you ?
no , he didn' t tell me you' d be coming .
i' m not surprised .

n o .
i ' m here on my own . and i ' m here to work .
m aybe he' il come and visit .
i' m glad he' s not here .
are you going to be staying long ?
i don' t know .
i don' t have much work these days . so , which bedroom did you take ?
the one upstairs overlooking the pool .
of course .
that' s the best one .
well , i' m gonna unpack .
sorry .
hello .
leave your name , number and any message you might have ... and i' il get right back to you .
bastard !
you could have told me your daughter was coming to your bloody house .
how do you expect me to work now ?
it' s sarah .
good bye .
i couldn' t get through to london .
i s there an yt hin g to eat ?
yes .
go and look for it in the kitchen .
personally , i' m gonna go back to bed .

fine .
good night . sarah , right ?
right .
i' m julie .
you' re not too hot ?
sorry .
i woke you up .
no .
i was just dozing .
you must be working too hard .
you should have a swim in the pool .
the water' s cold .
it' il wake you up .
well , thank you for your advice , but i absolutely loathe swimming pools .
yeah , i know what you mean .
i prefer the sea too .
the ocean .
the crashing waves . the f eelin g o f dan g er . that you could lose f ootin g at any time and be swept away .
pools are boring .
there' s no excitement , no no feeling of infinity .
i t' s j ust a bi g bathtub .
it' s more like a cesspool of living bacteria .
oh , that ?
no , it' s just a bit of dirt and leaves .
s o . what are you writin g ?
a romance novel ?
god , no .
i write crime fiction .
o h . yeah . that' s how he makes his money .
and that' s how he can afford to buy a beautiful house in france for his daughter to enjoy .
what about you ?
are your books selling well ?
i can' t complain .
what is this one about ? murders and a police investigation .
in the lub e ron with rich english tourists .
listen , if you don' t mind , i do have work to do .
okay .
i leave you alone , miss marple .
i need to make some phone calls an yw ay .
he was at the macumba ?
no way !
with jean pierre ?
yeah , right .
what a pervert !
you' re gross !
he came back ?
i don' t know .
going shopping ?
no , i' m going to have lunch in the village .
ah , good idea .
by the way , i spoke to marcel .
he' s coming very soon for the pool .
his english bitch has a broomstick up her butt .
may i have the bill ?
please .
yes .
e n g lish ]
h ello ?
d on' t wor ry about it .
i' m not going to bother her .
anyway , it' s a big house .
did you ring mom ?
i' m telling you , she' s still waiting , so hurry up .
yes , c' est c a .
c iao .
it' s your publisher .
john ?
hello ?
john ?
he hung up .
hello ?
hello , this is sarah morton .
could i speak tojohn , please ?
he' s gone out .
oh .
really ?
well , could you ask him to call me back in france ?
okay then .
yes , thank you .
good bye .
he scolded me .
he told me not to bother you .
he said i should leave you alone so you could work .
listen, julie .
i' m going to be frank with you .
i need peace and quiet to concentrate .
and since we share the same living space ,
i must ask you just to go about your business without getting in the way of mine , hmm ?
i mean , this house is certainly big enough for the two of us . so , please make an effort .
i was only trying to be polite and make friends .
but if you prefer i don' t i don' t prefer anything !
i just want to work on my book in peace .
fine .
that' s too bad , though , because i just bought loads of nice food .
i guess i have to eat my foie gras all alone .
c a va ?
we' re almost there .
i' m wasted .
are you okay ?
where are we ? my house .
you live here ?
yeah , i swear !

i hope we weren' t too loud ?
i don' t speak french .
i can' t understand a word .

i' ve got to get to work .
just a quickie .
i' d love to , but i' ve really got to go .
and there' s that woman .
you saw her ?
yeah , she' s outside . she' s a foreigner ?
yes .

not bad looking . so fuck her , if you like old maids !
i was just kidding .

want me to drive you ?
it' s not far . see you later .
thanks .
it was nice .
call me sometime .
no problem .
c iao .
is everything all right ?
yes .
are you from around here ?
yes , lacoste .
have you been there ?
no .
the marquis de sade' s castle is there .
oh , right .
i' ve heard about it .
it' s practically in ruins now , isn' t it ?
you can say that again .
but there' s a nice panoramic view of the lub e ron .
it' s beautiful .
i' il let you finish .
oh , it' s you .
your bedroom' s not big enough for you ?
yes , it is , but he snores like a pig .
i couldn' t get to sleep .
expecting another one ?
bonjour .
i' ve come for the pool .
julie called .
hi , marcel .
hello .
how are you ?
not bad .
you' re back already ?
i was sick of work .
i felt like a rest .
this is sarah , a friend of my father' s .
yes , we' ve met .
are you cleaning the pool today ?
isn' t that what you wanted, julie ? sarah wants to swim , but it' s too dirty for her .
b on j our .
where' s the girl ?
what girl ?
i forget her name .
the little blonde .
julie , maybe ?
that' s it . julie , right .
check out in the backyard by the pool .
i believe she' s getting some air .
thanks , madame .
bernard , this is marcel .
he' s my dad . stop joking .
come on , marcel !
going out ?
yes .
d o i have to ask f or your permission ?
well , it would be nice if you didn' t make any noise when you came home .
yes , mother .
i pity your mother .
you pity her ?
why ?
well , i imagine having a daughter who comes home with a different man every night must be difficult for a mother .
well , you imagine wrong .
you know what ?
you' re just a frustrated english woman ... who writes about dirty things but never does them .
you can shove your uptight morals up your ass .
**** [ f lute p layin g o n t v ]
i was worried when you didn' t come home .
are you gonna tell my daddy ?
yes , maybe i will .
then why don' t you ?
he would love it .
i' m not so sure about that .
how can you be so naive ?
he' s the king of orgies .
didn' t you know ?
julie ?
yes ?
would you like to go out to dinner tonight ?
s hall we g o ?
are you ready ?
yes , i' m coming .
you' re working , as usual .
o h .
i was j ust rereadin g an old piece .
this is my underwear .
what' s it doing here ?
i found it in the garden near the pool .
where shall we go ?
not too far .
i' m exhausted .
i see the waiter isn' t here tonight .
franck ? maybe .
i don' t know his name .
it' s franck , a boy from lacoste .
during the off season he only works days .
i see .
do you know him well ?
a little .
i see him around sometimes .
you seem to know just about everyone here .
well , of course .
i' ve spent my whole childhood here .
but not with john ?
no .
he abandoned us , my mother and i.
he just came here for the summer on holiday .
do you resent him for that ?
no , not really .
he lives his life , i live mine .
what about your mother , is she french ?
yeah .
where does she live ?
in nice .
why are you so interested now ?
oh .
oh , i don' t know .
well , maybe you and i got off to a bad start .
i was angry with you well , actually , i was angry atjohn ... for not really telling me about you or her .
he' s the one you' re interested in .
when someone keeps an entire part of their life secret from you , it' s fascinating and frightening .
i don' t deny that i want to know more .
but don' t count on me to tell you any secrets .
if you wanna know something , you should askjohn .
i' m not asking anyone anything .
yeah , sure .
you may pretend you don' t care , but i can see you' re hoping i tell you some things about my father .
actually , i' m more interested in your mother .
why don' t you live with her in nice ?
that' s a long story .
shall we order ?
yes .
s ' il vous plait .
i was 1 3 the first time .
i haven' t stopped since .
i fell in love once .
we were 1 6 .
it was summertime .
he was ... handsome , romantic , coming from paris .
his name was christian .
i was crazy about him .
i wanted him to take me , but i was too fast for him .
he was a baby .
he didn' t know how to do those things yet .
he was terrible .
he came on me after two seconds .
so i dumped him .
he wrote to me for a year , but i never wrote back .
i remember once in the f o rt we built in the f orest . he asked me to mar ry him .
i t' s stupid .
i know . we were j ust kids . but it made me c ry .
i t was the first time anyone [ i nhales s harply ]
i ' m sor ry .
i ' m borin g you with my stories .
no .
no , go on .
i' m enjoying it .
go on ?
with what ?
what happened to your eye ?
it' s nothing . some asshole tried to hit me , but i fought back .
he was bleeding like a pig .
nobody better mess with me , because if they do , i' il mess with them back .
i suppose you don' t want any ?
why not ?
never judge a book by its cover .
i' ve done my share of smoking .
and fucking ?
yes .
i was around in swinging london .
yeah . my mom already told me about it .
what did she tell you ?
how she metjohn .
how she seduced him .
how is your book coming ?
it' s coming .
although , i must say , it is quite strange ... to be writing a typically english story set in london ... while i' m here in this house in such beautiful weather . my mom wrote a book too , but it was never published .
he told her it was awful , so she burned it .
well , that' s terrible .
did you read it ?
yeah .
i liked it .
it was a bit sentimental , kind of a harlequin romance , but charming .
what was it about exactly ?
about her and my f ather .
i t was a love sto ry with a happy endin g .
but what he wants is blood , sex and money .
that' s what you give to him , isn' t it ?
yes .
but i like all that too .
did your mother live in this house ?
s ometimes . with my f ather . especially in the summe rt ime .
b ut once they were truly separated . she didn' t want to come back anymore .
s he went to live in n ice .
an yw ay . it' s really his house .
d id she want him to come and live with her in f rance ?
yeah .
s he wanted him to leave his wi f e and f amily in l ondon f or her .
b ut j ohn would never do that .
m y mother was terri f i e d to be alone here .
n ot me .
i am like you .
julie ?
julie , are you here ?
good evening .
hello there .
i' d like you to meet a friend of mine who' s come for a drink .
hello , madame .
i didn' t know you were atjulie' s .
i forgot to tell you , sarah' s a writer friend of my father' s .
you didn' t tell me you write .
yeah , mysteries . so watch your back !
could you make us a drink , sarah ?
i' il go get some weed in my room .
sit down , franck . make yourself at home .
whiskey ?
yes .
thank you .
this time you' re serving me .
got it .
what shall we drink to ?
i don' t know .
i know .
to sarah' s book .
to sarah' s book .
what' s it about ?
oh , i never discuss a book before it' s finished .
how about the last one then ?
a police investigation in scotland .
what was it called ?
i don' t know the french title .
in english it was d o rw ell wears a kilt .
what ?
what' s that mean ?
d o rw ell wears a kilt .
that' s too funny !

sarah ?
sarah .
what ?
thank you .
all ri g ht . that' s done .
i' m going to bed now .
s arah ? there' s somethin g y ou f or g ot to burn .
what' s that ?
your book .
it could be used as evidence .
did you read it ?
no , but i just can imagine .
well , stop imagining , huh ?
get yourself to bed .
we got work to do tomorrow .
listen .
i' ve thought it over .
we have to carry on with our lives as if nothing has happened .
you should call marcel and ask him to come up this afternoon to do some work .
like cut the grass ?
why not ?
it' s important for everything to appear normal ... as it was before .
another thing , did anyone see you with franck before the two of you came here ?
no .
are you sure ?
yeah .
i went to his house .
he lives in an isolated place outside lacoste .
and after , we came directly here in my car .
did anyone see you along the way ?
i don' t think so .
did he have any family ?
no .
his parents are dead .
right .
are you going back to london ?
not straightaway .
that would look suspicious .
why are you helping me , sarah ?
well , why wouldn' t i help you ?
i don' t know .
do you think they will arrest me ?
no , not necessarily .
if you do exactly as i say , i don' t think there' il be any problems .
and why should i believe you ?
because you write about murders in your books ?
absolutely .
marcel .
m arcel .
sarah .
oh .
it' s you .
i came to say g ood bye .
i want to let you finish your book .
i' m going to saint tropez .

it' s possibly for the best .
are you going to tell my father ?

i' ve got nothing to tell him .
you' re right .

how did you get that scar on your stomach ?
is that for your book ?
yes .

yes , well .
i' ve read it .
i don' t know what to say .
you didn' t like it , did you ?
i wouldn' t say that , exactly .
oh , come on, john . stop beating around the bush .
give me the truth .
well , i don' t understand what you' re trying to say .
and i don' t recognize you in it .
i thought that' s what you wanted .
you wanted something more personal .
yes , i know , but i
i don' t think writing about feelings is your strong suit . murders , investigations , that' s your line of country .
i mean , this is far too subtle .
i t' s too abstract .
where' s the action ?
where are the plot twists ? so , what' s your advice ? shall i burn it ?
