so the tap was still running when you found her .
calm down .
you don' t have to cry .
i' m not too sure , but i heard mari was going out with an american soldier .
mari from charade' s committed suicide .
stupid girl .
she didn' t have to kill herself .
maybe she' s got the " clap .
you can' t get upset over a minor thing if you' re doing business with american soldiers .
did you hear about the suicide at the base school last month ?
there seem to be a lot of them lately .
apparently , everybody' s really uptight about it .
how terrible .
i hope this doesn' t affect business .
it can' t be helped if we' re going to make a living off the base .
huh ?
it can' t be helped if we' re going to make a living off the base .
aren' t you japanese ?
you are not a student here , are you ?
did you pass through the office ?
hey , hold on a second !
where is the principal' s office ?
huh ?
so , this is their " dining room" then .
oh , you scared me .
what were you doing here ?
nothing .
l thought i had a headache .
but it" s gone now .
oh .
wait !
hold on a minute !
you ...
hey !
hey !
listen to me !
listen , just forget what you just saw .
why ...
what is this ...

linda wasn" t feeling well .
she was just sleeping ...
linda ...
linda ...

what is this ?
linda ...
hey , mama san , where" s my beer ?
oh , l" m sorry .
excuse me .
l" il be right back .
what are you doing ?
run for it !
run !
go inside .
what did you just do ?
what are you trying to do here ?
shut up !
listen !
anyone who is marked by " them " or anyone who has seen " their " real form , isn" t allowed to live .
so , we" ve got to kill " them " before " they " get us .
what are " they " ?
demons .
they live off human blood .
shit !
isn" t there something ?
like what ?
a weapon .
here ...
that won" t kill them .
they won" t die unless they lose enough blood in one blow .
then what is this gun for ?
you may need it .
you can kill yourself as a last resort .
don" t !
why me ?
who are you ?
why did you help me ?
you" re lucky .
l can" t kill " humans .
shut up !
wait !
don" t shoot !
i can" t take this anymore .
don" t give up !
get the car !
run the doors down !
after all , l never understood what i saw .
that girl saya and the creatures she killed all remained a mystery .
only two students were noted as having left for other schools .
could she still be somewhere around the base ?
is she still fighting those creatures ?
just as we humans continue to kill each other .
that beautiful , yet dangerous living thing
