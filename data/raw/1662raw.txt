it' d better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego ?
let' s go !
and you pick this year off my shoulders .
lf you gonna have a mating partner , at least pick a female with the same color palette , right ?
and i thought , wow , he' s gonna go primal , you know what i' m saying ?
lf you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
ln your case , it' s grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mate in life is stupid .
i mean everybody just sit around . . .
mandy ?
look at that .
he' s okay .
she' s gone .
hey , mandy , are you forgetting something ?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i' m still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can' t leave him here .
look , there' s smoke .
that' s his heir right up the hill .
we should return him .
let' s get something straight .
there' s no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
ln fact , without me , there wouldn' t even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i' m not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i' il take care of him .
go .
yeah , that' s good .
you take care of him ?
you can' t even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i' il return him .
we don' t need that mandy .
you know we do .
you' re embarrassing the nature , do you know that ?
i' m fine .
i' m fine !
i' m gonna die .
that thing is mine .
no , actually that thing belongs to us .
us ?
you two are barely a couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
you can have one of your own so you won' t adopt .
look , i' m sorry to interrupt this .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i' m returning to his heir .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you' re calling me a lair ?
i didn' t say that .
you were thinking it .
i don' t like this cat .
he reads mind .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i' m not your friend .
fine , manfred .
lf you' re looking for its heir , you' re wasting your time .
he left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
i beat this .
all right , i' il help you bring it to its heir .
but promise me you' d leave me alone after that .
okay , deal .
what' s your problem ?
you' re my problem .
but i think you' re stressed .
that' s why you eat so much .
it' s hard to get fat on a diet .
i' m not fat .
it' s all this fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , yeah .
fat hair .
but when you' re ready to talk , i' m here .
just drop it on the land .
shouldn' t we make sure they found him ?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
don' t spear me !
this is a problem .
now what ?
that' s perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don' t you have some flaw defenseless animals to disembogue ?
they couldn' t be far .
they went this way ?
or this way ?
you don' t know much about tracking , do you ?
i must lost .
i see trees , either leaves , that' s my tracking .
you didn' t miss them by much .
it' s still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
ls it ?
they head north 2 hours ago .
you don' t need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track human down faster than you can .
and you' re just a good citizen helping out , right ?
i just know where the human will go .
find the pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
unless you know how to track , you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it' s your choice .
here' s your little bundle of joy .
we' il return it to the human .
big bad tiddy widdy get cliff .
poor tiddy widdy . . .
sid , tiddy widdy is gonna lead the way .
mandy , can i talk to you for a second ?

the sooner we find the human , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drew face .
and the baby too .
you always have that jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i' il be tuning on it .

i think this thing didn' t complain this much .
stop shouting at me .
you' re holding it wrong .

lts nose is dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
maybe we should lick it .
just in case .
i' il do it .
you know , the baby stinks .
so if it poops , where does it go ?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
why am i the poop checker ?
because returning it is your idea .
because you' re small and insignificant
and because i' il pound you if you don' t .
what else ?
