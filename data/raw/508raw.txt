you know what i' m talking about .
last time out , i went down , and you disappeared .
look , you aren' t the only one who lost something that day .
when the fire started , you were busy with the general .
some of us went in to see who we could save .
now , you think this looks bad ?

hey , get your ass out the driver' s seat .
mission accomplished .
darius stone .
born south side , d. c.
mother died young , father raised him .
not much to report till ' 88 .
his dad was killed by a stray bullet in a 211 , and darius went off the grid .
started with graffiti , reckless driving .
quickly worked his way up to grand theft auto and resisting arrest .
took him some time to find his calling in the navy .
specifically , the navy seals .
trained sniper , top scores .
urban recon , demolition .
the highest dive in navy history , 250 feet .
augustus gibbons recruited him into an elite unit , level 5 classified .
ran ops in eastern europe till christmas in kosovo .
their general ordered them to set a fire to clear civilians ... ... but stone refused .
led a mutiny against a four star general ... ... the current secretary of defense , george deckert ... ... who had him court martialed for a 20 year term .
ten for disobeying direct orders ... ... and another 10 for breaking the general' s jaw .
this is the last footage we have on him .
a meeting with his lawyer , jonathan edward cochran .
oh , that' s cute .
johnnie cochran .
i don' t think mr. stone can afford johnnie' s fee .
do we have audio ?
it' s attorney client .
no mikes .
hold it there .
okay , reel it back .
back , back , back .
freeze it .
blow it up .
gibbons and stone on a comeback tour .
all right , listen up .
i want all eyes up and running on these two .
and i want hard 20s on the rest of their old unit .
i wanna know where they are ... ... i wanna know what they' re doing , and i wanna know now .
i' m disappointed , auggie .
checkmate in three ?
you should' ve seen it coming .
relax .
have a drink .
i took the liberty of pouring myself ...
you were always taking liberties .
same old gibbons .
good soldier with a bad attitude .
you know , i always remember the first day we met .
i remember the last day i saw you .
i bet you do .
didn' t heal too well , did it ?
some wounds never do .
i never asked you to go into that fire .
you just set it and watched it burn .
we did what needed to be done .
is that what you call it ?
doing what you need to do " ?
sixteen of my men killed ?
what' s that , just more friendly fire ?
some men die so others may live .
funny ... ... that you never seem to be the one doing any of the dying .
i' il do whatever it takes to best protect this nation .
you' re not protecting the nation .
you' re doing this to protect yourself .
why ?
what fires you starting now ?
we both live in the same world .
we know what' s out there .
save the speech .
just so you know ... ... whatever you' re up to , you' re not getting away with it .
why ?
because darius stone is gonna stop me ?
i' m sorry .
was that supposed to be a surprise ?
gibbons , i know every move you make even before you do .
you still work for me , whether you know it or not .
i never worked for you .
i work for my country .
i don' t know what' s more pathetic ... ... a man that plays chess with himself ... ... or a man that doesn' t see he' s already lost .
make it look like an accident .
zero exposure .
sir , they found gibbons .
investigators say an apparent gas leak triggered the explosion .
the fire department was too late to save the occupant ... ... but managed to contain the fire before it spread .
the deceased , augustus gibbons , was a former navy captain .
he was 51 years old .
the funeral' s tomorrow at arlington national cemetery .
gas leak .
right .
this is lisa joyner reporting from chevy chase , maryland for wjla .
back to you in the studio .
toby , let' s get to work .
there' s nothing on here .
nothing .
it' s blank , man .
because you' re looking in the wrong place .
gibbons said it was on the hard drive .
what are you doing ?
i read about that .
cold war .
old school , right ?
not that old school .
all right .
now , which one' s charlie ?
only one way to find out .
ready .
aim .

ready .

like our lord and savior ... ... augustus eugene gibbons died in our service .
head of the nsa , fbl , joint chiefs , secretary of state .
damn .
you know what this means , right ?
what ?
they' re gonna kill me next .
give me those .
damn , man .
if we' re working together , you should work on your partner skills .

okay .
see , now , that' s a start .
not bad .
deckert ?

but he hated everything about gibbons .
so , what is he doing here ?
charlie .
you found him .
her .
her ?
can you get me a suit ?
oh , so now you wanna blend .
i hear this place has the best gumbo in town .
excuse me .
i' m actually meeting someone for lunch .
relax , charlie .
this' il only take a minute .
how did you know my name ?
who are you ?
we have a mutual friend .
augustus gibbons .
had a mutual friend .
and you didn' t answer my question .
who are you ?
my name is darius stone .
stone ?
you have half the suits in this city looking for you .
why in the world would you come here ?
trust me ... ... they won' t look for a guy like me in a place like this .
well , no offense , but i don' t trust anybody right now .
good .
that means we got something in common .
charlie .
i' m sorry i' m so late .
i had that urban youth meeting .
it ran over .
we' re trying to set up that after school ... ... gun instructional program for kids and ...
i' m sorry .
dickie ambrose , nra .
hi .
reverend billy bob baker , southern baptist brotherhood .
well , it' s just great to meet you , reverend .
hey , listen , we' re setting up this rally upstate next week ... ... and i was just wondering if there was some way we could attract ... ... you know , some upstanding african americans like yourself .
you got any advice for us ?
well , dick , perhaps you could tell your members ... ... to stop buying country music , stop burning crosses ... ... and stop shooting black folks .
hear me ?
now , if that don' t work ... ... try a cookout with free food .
preferably fried .
dick ... ... would you mind terribly if we rescheduled ?
i think that would be ...
yeah , that' s fine .
i have a lot of stuff to do .
reverend , i' il ...
call me .
i' il call you about that .
tell me about you and the captain .
i was gibbons ' contact on the hill .
i' m an aide to the senate subcommittee on military action .
military ?
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert ?
there' s not a bullet shot in the dark that he don' t know about .
so tell me something , charlie .
can you get me close to him ?
well , reverend ... ... you think you can lay your hands on a tuxedo ?
you made it .
you know , i never miss a party .
not quite the tux i had in mind .
yes , but i' m blending .
you see the guest of honor ?
those bodyguards ?
seal team four .
half my old unit .
and not the better half .
who' s the ugly general he' s talking to ?
jack pettibone .
vice chair , joint chiefs .
doesn' t look too happy .
must be the music .
one way to find out .
i truly can' t believe what i' m hearing .
we go back 30 years , jack .
same blood in the same mud , and you never questioned my command .
i presume you' ve heard of the united states congress .
jack ... ... this country is being led down the wrong path .
you really think you can do this , don' t you ?
with just a few regiments .
once we lead , the full force will follow .
the clock is ticking .
with or without you .
three days .
he' s here .
black guy , white tux .
had enough of the party ?
hold on .
you asked me to track down the rest of their old troop ?
well , half of them are still enlisted .
what about the other half ?
gone .
missing .
the same men that backed stone against deckert .
every single one of them just disappeared .
wait a minute .
this is your home ?
not bad for a senator' s aide .
i' m not just a senator' s aide .
i' m also a senator' s daughter .
james mayweather , virginia .
think daddy' s ready to meet a guy like me ?
actually , daddy' s out of town .
really ?
make yourself at home , darius .
not a bad place to grow up , i guess .
only on the surface .
growing up in d. c. politics is like living in a snake pit .
everybody fighting for territory .
sounds a lot like where i grew up .
oh , no .
this is nothing like where i grew up .
let' s get you out of those clothes , shall we ?
here we go .
why don' t you try these on .
not really my style .
why don' t you go ahead and get cleaned up .
there' s some fresh towels in the bathroom .
full service , huh ?
you know , if you need anything ... ... i' m just right down the hall .
anything ?
anything at all .
how about some fries and a shake ?
the things i can' t do for my country .
charlie ?
charlie .
pettibone ?
she set me up .
bitch .
this is the police .
come out with your hands behind your head .
we got the vice chair of the joint chiefs in there .
the assailant is armed and dangerous .
proceed with extreme caution , gentlemen .
gus , get me a hostage negotiator , clear a two block radius ... ... and five is the active perimeter .
better make that 10 .
captain , the man' s a special forces sniper .
keep all fields clear at least half a mile downwind .
who the hell are you ?
kyle steele , nsa .
captain , i need to speak to this man alive .
so ?
it' s a matter of national security , sir .
where the hell are you going ?
going inside .
listen , i don' t care who you are .
you got six minutes till we breach .
stone .
i' m coming in unarmed .
all right , close that door .
hands .
step forward .
how you know i wouldn' t shoot you the second you stepped through ?
i didn' t .
you got five minutes till they knock that door down .
so let' s skip the chitchat .
where' s pettibone ?
upstairs , dead .
you do it ?
lf i did it ... ... you wouldn' t know until i wanted you to .
now , turn around .
stone , this doesn' t look too good , man .
an escaped convict breaks into a house with an automatic in hand ... ... and a dead man upstairs .
i didn' t break in .
now , move .
you didn' t break in here ?
so , what , the general invited you over for a nightcap ?
what happened ?
you guys felt like playing russian roulette ?
this is not my gun .
you expect me to buy that line ?
it' s not a line , it' s the truth .
they set me up .
who set you up ?
deckert .
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert .
he clipped gibbons when he got too close .
and now pettibone .
too close to what ?
stone , we have three minutes .
level with me .
why are we here ?
why' d you go after pettibone ?
i didn' t go after nobody .
i don' t even know the guy .
never seen him before in my life .
easy .
that sure looks a lot like you .
damn , they' re good .
think now is really the best time for a snack ?
what they got out there , three teams ?
flash bangs , body armor , heat scopes .
am i close ?
stone , i wanna help you here , i really do .
but if you run , you look guilty .
brother , i was born looking guilty .
and now ... ... it' s time for you to go .
where is he ?
where is he ?
captain , i got him .
looks like upstairs bathroom .
okay , go get him .
this is the last known photograph of the suspect .
cute picture .
yeah .
haircut suits you , definitely . near charlottesville , virginia .
the assailant is assumed to be armed and dangerous .
one of general pettibone' s closest friends ... ... was defense secretary george deckert .
jack pettibone was a dear friend of mine .
and tonight , this nation has lost a great patriot .
and his quiet contributions will be properly recorded ... ... in history books yet to be written .
from base to base , camp pendleton to fort bragg ... ...
general pettibone' s troops are en route ... ... to washington d. c.
for the funeral .
they' re not coming for the funeral .
same blood , same mud .
pettibone and deckert both served for over 30 years together .
so that means pettibone' s troops are also ... ?
deckert' s .
correct .
what' s that got to do with the funeral ?
the perfect cover .
deckert does the guest list ... ... only invites his boys to town .
he' s got his army .
now , he' s gotta be loading up .
how would he get his gear ?
all orders go through his department , the dod .
right .
you want me to hack in ?
to the u. s. department of defense ?
we' re talking 500 acres of hardware .
cray supercomputers , encryption chips ... ... not to mention more firewalls than the nsa , cla and the irs combined .
exactly .
hold my chips .
you know , you don' t have to wait up .
you think i' d leave you alone with my car ?
what' s so special about this one ?
shelby cobra prototype , 600 horses , 10, 000 rpm .
only three off the rack .
and we sold it for half a mil to some senator ... ... who' il never take her out of first gear .
half a mil for a car ?
you been gone a while , d.
everything' s more expensive now .
i could see that .
come here .
you' ve done real good , lo .
no rollbacks , part bins or stripped engines .
it' s a long way from zeke' s chop shop .
still got a few bins in the back .
and i still get my hands dirty .
classic' s still a classic .
you remember the first time we dropped gears in this one ?
i remember three squad cars at 100 plus on the parkway .
oh , she was fast .
yes , she was .
you remember all that damage we did in the back seat ?
that was a long time ago , d.
not for me .
ready to do some more damage ?
he shoots , he scores !
college boy just pulled off the hack of the century .
requisition order .
deckert' s bringing all his troops and armored vehicles ... ... through a naval base up the potomac to the uss independence .
it' s an aircraft carrier , man .
looks like we going upstate .
