it' s a thuggee ceremony .
they' re worshipping kali .
have you ever seen anything like this before ?
nobody' s seen this for a hundred years .
kali ma .
kali ma ...
kali ma !
he' s still alive .
kali ma .
kali ma ...
that' s the rock they took from the village .
it' s one of the sankara stones .
why they glow like that ?
shh , shh .
the legend says when the rocks are brought together , the diamonds inside them will glow .
diamonds ?
diamonds .
diamonds !
shh .
diamonds .
hey , hey .
look , i want you two to stay up here and keep quiet .
shorty , you keep an eye on her .
why , where are you going ?
down there .
down there ? !
are you crazy ? !
i' m not leaving here without the stones .
you could get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory !
maybe .
but not today .
be careful .
where' s he going ?
let me go ... !
run , willie !
run !
dr. jones !
i keep telling you , you listen me more , you live longer .
please , let me die .
i pray to siva ,
let me die , " but i do not .
now ... now the evil of kali take me .
how ?
they will make me drink the blood of the kali .
then i' il fall into the black sleep of the kali ma .
what is that ?
we become like them .
we' il be alive , but like a nightmare .
you drink blood , you not wake up from nightmare .
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones .
there were five stones in the beginning .
over the centuries , they were dispersed by wars , sold off by thieves like you .
thieves like me , huh ?
ha !
still missing two .
a century ago , when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
so that' s what you' ve got these slaves digging for , huh ?
they' re innocent children .
they dig for the gems to support our cause .
they also search for the last two stones .
soon we will have all the five sankara stones , and the thuggees will be all powerful .
what a vivid imagination .
you ... don' t believe me ?
you will , dr. jones .
you will become ... a true believer .
hi .
dr. jones !
don' t drink ... it' s bad !
don' t drink !
spit it out !
dr. jones ...
you dare not do that .
leave him alone , you bastards !
the british in india will be slaughtered .
then we will overrun the muslims .
then the hebrew god will fall .
and then the christian god will be cast down and forgotten .
soon , kali ma will rule the world .
dr. jones ...
kali ma protects us .
we are her children .
we pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh ...
what are you doing ? !
... and blood .
your friend has seen ... and she has heard .
now she will not talk .
i' m not going to have anything nice to say about this place when i get back .
