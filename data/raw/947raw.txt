bobby knight .

it' s my first day also .
i hope this class cures me .

dr. rydell ?
you don' t remember me , do you ?
i sat next to you on the plane .
oh , yeah , the headset guy .
good to see you again .
good to see you too .
that was a crazy flight .
they actually sentenced me to anger management for that .
really ?
wow .
this is incredible .
you could sign this for me ... ... and tell them i don' t have an anger problem if you want .
i can' t just sign your papers .
i didn' t do anything wrong .
you know that .
all right .
how' s this ?
just hang for one session ... ... so i can at least say i gave you a proper analysis .
then i' il sign your papers .
okay .
shall we ?
oh , yes .
yes .
so my boss , he was talking to me about how many sick days i' ve taken .
so my boss , he was talking to me about how many sick days i' ve taken .
and i was like , you know , " don' t go there .
but he kept on about wanting to see a doctor' s note or something .
and i said , " look , i' m seriously serious .
you don' t want to go there .
but he kept talking and talking , being such a nag ... ... and then i just blacked out .
i blacked out .
i told you not to go there !
i told you not to go there !
how do you feel you handled that situation ?
not as well as i could' ve .
remember , lou , temper' s the one thing you can' t get rid of by losing it .
dave .
hi , dave .
hi .
good news , i fed my anger monkey a banana this morning ... ... and he' s feeling much better .
more good news , you won' t have to listen to those lame jokes ... ... because i' m only here for one session .
dave assaulted a female flight attendant in midair .
nice .
i bet you beat her good .
i didn' t beat anybody .
i touched a woman .
liar .
bullshitter .
you' re a woman beater .
you can' t admit it because you' re a piece of garbage .
i don' t know about all that , but now i understand why you' re here .
i' m here because i was verbally attacked by my neighbor .
and i took a dump on his porch .
i guess you' re better than me .
that' s why you can' t cop to your rage .
you' re superior .
he' s superior .
maybe dave' s not ready yet , chuck .
you' re not ready .
hear what he said ?
let' s introduce dave to some of the rest of us .
girls , why don' t you tell dave what brought you here .
i' m sure he' d love to listen to what you guys have to say .
we always do .
come on , dave .
join us .
okay .
okay .
well , we' re in the adult film industry .
and we' re lovers .
one day , gina was having sex with this filipino guy melo ...
... which was cool , it was in the script .
sure .
and then i asked melo back to the house with us ... ... which is cool , because , well , we like a little variety .
variety' s good .
so anyway , in the middle of our session ... ... i look up and i see gina kissing melo on the mouth ... ... which is not cool because it violates our threesome code of ethics .
stacy bit my toe off .
then melo freaks out ...
... and calls me a crazy skank .
nobody talks to my bitch that way .
so i stapled his lips shut .
here we are .
well , we' ve all been there .
i like him .
yeah , he' s funny .
not as funny as you .
i like that .
all right , girls .
let it go .
let it go a little bit longer .
walk it off .
nate .
didn' t we decide that you shouldn' t listen to the ball game ?
don' t worry , dr. b , it' s just a regular season game .
not important .
he missed the lay up !
see ?
iverson just missed a lay up at the buzzer , sixers lose .
who gives a crap , huh ?
i mean , it' s just a silly game , anyways .
the anger sharks are swimming in my head .
you gotta dunk that shit !
you gotta dunk that shit !
listen to me .
stay with me , nate .
goosfraba .
goos blah blah .
not " blah blah , " nate .
goosfraba .
goosfraba .
that' s good .
slower .
goosfraba .
how do you feel ?
better .
good job , nate .
that sound is a derivation of an old eskimo word ... ... that mothers used to calm their children .
i see .
eskimos seem nice .
they do .
i think eskimos are smug .
hold that thought , chuck .
so , dave ... ... tell us about yourself .
who are you ?
well , i am an executive assistant ... ... at a major pet products company .
i don' t want you to tell us what you do .
i want you to tell us who you are .
all right .
i' m a pretty good guy .
i like playing tennis on occasion ....
tell us who you are .
i just ....
maybe you could give me an example of what a good answer would be .
what did you say ?
you want lou to tell you who you are ?
no , i just ....
i' m a nice , easygoing man .
i might be a little bit indecisive at times .
dave , you' re describing your personality .
i want to know ...
... who you are .
what the hell do you want me to say ?
i mean , i' m sorry .
i just ....
i want to answer your question .
i' m just not doing it right , i guess .
i think we' re getting a picture , dave .
let' s move on .
dr. rydell , i' d like to know something .
why is it that chuck thinks he can smoke ?
i do whatever i want when i want , you little spanish fruit topping .
honey , at least i didn' t make my aunt pregnant .
what are you laughing at , dave ?
just laughing .
i don' t know .
i' m not laughing at you .
were you laughing with me ?
because i' m not laughing .
am i out of line , or is this guy pushing me ?
well , how do you feel , chuck ?
i went from happy to angry , skipped sad .
now i feel like kicking his ass .
then we' il see who' s laughing .
what ?
think you' re better than me because you' ve got both your nuts ?
all right , man .
all right .
come on .
come on , big boy .
pretty boy .
all right .
is it worth going back to the penitentiary , chuck ?
so he' s laughing at you .
i' m not laughing at him .
goosfraba .
goosfraba .
okay .
good job , chuck .
that was really good .
where' s the coffee cake ?
i was looking forward to it .
where' s the coffee cake ?
i was looking forward to it .
i haven' t been to the actors studio in quite some time .
i' m sure your audition will go well .
thanks .
i hope so .
good night .
all right .
thanks , buddy .
bye bye .
that was a little bit insane .
if i had to do 20 hours of that , i' d end up killing myself .
here you go .
twenty hours in my class would be pointless for you .
i agree .
i think i' m going to recommend to the court that we double your time .
what do you mean ?
let me explain something .
there are two kinds of angry people : explosive and implosive .
explosive is the kind of individual that you see screaming at the cashier ... ... for not taking their coupons .
implosive is the cashier who remains quiet , day after day ... ... and finally shoots everyone in the store .
you' re the cashier .
no .
i' m the guy hiding in the frozen food section dialing 911 , i swear .
i' m going to assign you an anger ally ... ... to help calm you down when you' re losing it .
chuck .
not chuck .
give me bobby knight , or the porno girls .
heard we' re partnering up , huh ?
yes .
here' s my number .
great .
you' re going to die , bitch .
oops , that' s a letter i' m writing to geraldo rivera .
i see .
my bad .
here .
that' s the number .
good .
thank you .
dave and chuck ... ... working together as a team .
it' s a win win situation .
yeah , feels it .
dave' s particulars .
i' il see you soon .
the yanks are great this season .
dave thinks they could beat seattle' s win record .
remember at brown when we saw ron guidry win his 20th ?
oh , man .
he was on fire that year .
we could' ve been too .
andrew , don' t start or i can' t hang out with you anymore .
sorry , it' s just hard .
i' il never meet anyone as good as you .
you will .
she' il be a very lucky lady .
thanks for being my best friend .
linda .
hey , dave .
andrew .
good to see you guys hugging .
how was the doctor ?
psychotic .
well , did you get any good promotion news from mr. head ?
i wasn' t able to talk to him about that yet , but i will .
not that crowded here .
you' d think it would be packed .
i rented the place .
i figured it' d be more fun if it was just brown alumni .
where' d you go to college again ?
trenton community college .
you had a hard day .
let me buy you a milk shake .
later , andrew . once you cast your line in , so during retrieval ... ... it' il help you to create a realistic and a erratic ....
hey , dave .
hey .
andrew , what' s up ?
not much .
you always try to simulate live bait .
okay , they got fishing while you go to the bathroom .
that' s nice .
yep .
bass fishing .
hey , he caught one .
be aware of your presentation ... ... and make sure that , as you work it along ....
oh , yeah .
congratulations .
now that is a big one , folks .
always a blast being with your friends .
it was a great night .
yankees winning , beer and hot dogs .
yeah , you like those foot iong hot dogs , don' t you ?
so i saw your boy andrew at the urinal .
saw his ...
... thing .
you were looking ?
yeah , unfortunately .
so , now , did this guy grow up near a nuclear power plant or something ?
what are you talking about ?
never really seen nothing like that before .
didn' t it used to scare you ?
i never saw it .
you never saw it ?
no , i told you , i never slept with him .
why , is it huge ?
no .
no .
no .
no .
it' s actually quite petite .
i felt bad for him .
it looked like it belonged on a baby and it had a funny color .
i bet he got a lot of snickers in the locker room .
like , " what the hell' s that thing ?
when you' re in a locker room , you must feel good about yourself .
i do .
if there are 20 naked guys in there , i' m usually in the top 18 .
which isn' t bad .
you' re doing really good .
thanks .
who' s that ?
i don' t know .
let me get rid of them .
hello ?
dave , it' s me , chuck .
who' s chuck ?
your anger ally .
i' m in a mood , dave .
a bad mood .
a very bad mood .
i was fired from my ice cream truck job today .
no more fudgeicles .
what' s an anger ally ?
who' s that ?
she making fun of me ?
no .
that' s my girlfriend .
you tell her to put a sock in it because i need to talk to you right now !
we' re a little busy right now .
you' re busy ?
we' re all busy , okay ?
you come down here before a black wolf swallows my brain !
hookers , booze , shooting holes in the ceiling , screaming myself to sleep .
finally , my parents said i had to move out .
i' m guessing that' s when you decided to shack up with your aunt .
don' t get cute , wiseass !
but , yes .
what' s with the watch , huh ?
am i boring you ?
we ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago and i kind of gotta get back .
miss ?
excuse me , miss ?
is this slow and stupid waitress day ?
i' m sorry .
i be right with you .
damn , man , reminds me of these chicks back in the war .
would give you the old licky licky , then fry your banana .
settle .
i have seen some shit , man .
i kid you not , i have seen some shit .
wake up to the sound of kids screaming .
explosions everywhere .
never know when your number' s up .
vietnam , huh ?
grenada , man .
grenada ?
wasn' t that like 12 hours long ?
did you see that ?
see what ?
that guy .
he just gave me a look .
he didn' t give you a look .
and i' m pretty sure i heard him mutter some kind of anti semitic remark .
are you jewish ?
i could be .
but , no .
half irish , half italian , half mexican .
let' s go give those guys some tsuris .
well , the guy on the left is blind , chuck .
i hear you .
he' s yours .
no .
that' s not what i was saying .
hey .
what the hell ?

what' s going on ?
don' t !
stop it !
stop !
stop !
goosfraba !
you piece of shit !
stop it !
stop it !
welcome back , mr. buznik .
i see you' ve managed to brutalize a cocktail waitress this time .
i guess beating up stewardesses can get old after a while .
flight attendant , your honor .
i didn' t hit her on purpose , your honor .
i was being attacked by someone ... ... and while i was trying to take away his ....
his ....
trying to take away my cane , your honor .
you cracked a waitress in the face ... ... while attempting to steal a blind man' s cane ?
your honor , we' re not even sure how blind this man really is .
okay .
my bad .
moving on .
happy now , ass wipe ?
mr. buznik , i don' t know why you hate women .
maybe you don' t know either ... ... but i' il let you think about it while you spend one year in a state prison .
isn' t that a bit harsh , your honor ?
no !
okay .
may i approach , your honor ?
by all means , dr. rydell .
thank you .
it' s been a while .
yes , it has .
you look marvelous , brenda .
thank you .
and how are the boys ?
fantastic .
james made the basketball team , raheem landed the lead ... ... in fiddler on the roof .
raheem will make a breathtaking tevye , i' m sure .
so do you have a take on this buznik guy ?
is this good or bad ?
well , it' s bad that he' s talking to her ... ... but it' s good that ....
no , it' s bad .
it' s all bad .
you think you can help him ?
i think so , your honor .
if i can' t , i' il tear him apart with my bare hands .
mr. buznik ... ... because of the enormous respect i have for dr. rydell ... ... i' m placing you in his intensive anger management program ... ... for 30 days .
but if you fail to strictly adhere to the rules of his program ... ... you will spend the next year in state prison .
buddy ?
good evening .
ready to get it on ?
get what on ?
what are you doing here ?
well , well , well .
the lair of the rage rhino .
i smell the effluvium of pain and frustration .
where should we put my stuff ?
what stuff ?
we' ve got 30 days to control your anger .
my approach dictates intense observation .
what better vantage point than bunkmates ?
put that there , dan , thank you very much .
no .
no .
i' m sorry .
guys , i don' t think you should be moving in with me .
sit down , dave .
let' s be perfectly clear about this .
you' ve been deemed a threat to society .
i believe that radical , round the clock therapy ... ... is the only way to effect a meaningful and positive change ... ... in your behavior .
now we can do it here or rikers island .
anything else , dr. b ?
no thanks , dan .
we' il install the wiretaps tomorrow .
wiretaps ?
is this your cd collection ?
yes .
oh , my .
what are you doing ?
i don' t want you listening to any angry music .
the carpenters are angry ?
i mean ....
don' t be naive , dave .
close to you .
we' ve only just begun .
songs of madness and obsession .
who' s going to pay for that ?
retard your anger level a few notches and listen to me .
can you do that ?
yeah .
it' s retarded .
i' m retarded .
good .
now then , we need to go over some ground rules .
my girlfriend got me that .
you' re to refrain from violent acts including verbal assault ... ... and vulgar hand gestures .
you may not use rage enhancing substances ... ... such as caffeine , nicotine , alcohol , crack cocaine ... ... slippy flippies , jelly stingers , trick sticks ... ... bing bangs or flying willards .
how about fiddle faddles ?
under my supervision .
also , if you are unable to stop masturbating ... ... please do so without the use of any pornographic images ... ... depicting quote unquote " angry sex .
that having been said , i' m a pretty good guy ... ... and i think you' il be pleasantly surprised ... ... at how much fun we can have .
jeez , without slippy flippies or angry masturbating ?
how is that possible ?
sarcasm is anger' s ugly cousin .
from now on , unacceptable .
dave , i got this for you .
it' s a wonderfully therapeutic tool .
record your thoughts on this whenever you feel angry .
i' m feeling very angry right now ... ... because i only have one bed and no couch .
not a problem .
in europe , it' s not considered unusual for three or four men to share a bed .
yeah , well , that' s why i' m proud to be an american .
by the way ....
i like to sleep in the nude .
you hear that frog ?
nope .
what do you want ?
i' m just recording your demeanor upon awakening .
good to see you got your underwear back on .
6 : 30 ?
i don' t gotta be up till 7 .
you' ve got to make my breakfast .
dave , cooking is very relaxing and therapeutic .
i want two eggs , over easy and unfertilized ... ... wheat toast , dry , and please ... ... tell me you' ve got ketchup .
there' s a denny' s down the street .
not only do they have ketchup ... ... but they got the angriest waitresses i' ve seen .
you could have a blast with the goosfraba thing down there .
lame o .
your eggs .
holy shit !
i said over easy !!
now , why did i do that ?
because i refused to spoon with you last night ?
the angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes .
alpha bits .
no matter how old i get , always a culinary delight .
no explanation for the egg throwing .
he' s a psycho .
don' t sulk , dave .
eat .
sit down .
we' il be off to work in a jiffy .
we' il be off to work . " now , by " we' il , " i assume you mean just me , right ?
well , i have to join you at work .
full contact .
that will make me look nuts , buddy , bringing a shrink to work ... ... you whipping eggs at people .
i don' t know .
you must never be ashamed that you sought help for yourself , dave .
it' s not a weakness .
i mean , i gotta be there by 9 : 00 .
i don' t think we' il make it on time .
you' re not even dressed .
wherever you look ... ... there' s something to be seen .
look , dave .
what exactly was that all about ?
what ?
you just ran through a red light .
are you trying to get us both killed ?
i' m a little flustered right now .
i have to be to work in eight minutes .
flustered ?
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa , man !
holy shit !
what are you doing ?
i need you to unfluster .
my boss is going to go nuts on me if we' re late , so please ?
we will proceed when you are centered .
i' m centered , i' m centered .
there' s 10, 000 people behind us .
let' s go , crazy man .
what is that ?
is that good ?
we' re going to sing a song .
no .
i don' t want to sing a song .
i want to go to ....
i' ve gotta go .
here we go .
the magic of leonard bernstein and stephen sondheim' s ... ... west side story .
i feel pretty .
get this moving .
what the hell' s your problem ?
shut your pie hole !
we' re working here !
wow .
sorry .
move your ass , dipshit !
burn in hell !
yes !
you feel stunning .
and entrancing .
you' re late .
yes .
there was a little bit of a tie up on the bridge .
i didn' t ask for a traffic report .
you' re always late .
now is the first time i' ve been late .
but you' re right .
i' m sorry .
may i interject ?
you were about to say something else before you said , " i' m sorry .
we mustn' t absorb and repress .
who' s this ?
i' m his anger management therapist .
you' re in anger management ?
temporarily , yeah .
do you remember the flight to st. louis ... ... that i was on when they had to turn the plane around ?
yeah , yeah .
because of that unruly passenger in coach .
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
he doesn' t like people touching his clubs .
well , that unruly passenger was me .
i got arrested at kennedy .
that' s why i didn' t make the next flight .
you said your apartment caught fire .
dissembling is a common tool of the anger junkie .
might i have your first name , mr. head ?
and tell me it isn' t dick .
it' s frank .
fran .
isn' t that normally a girl' s name ?
what went on on that flight ?
to be honest with you , it was a mix up .
i ....
jibber jabber .
jibber jabbering .
mumbo jumbo .
denial .
key , key , key , key , key , key .
fran , your assistant beat the bejesus out of a flight attendant .
i didn' t .
you broke her nose .
i broke the cocktail waitress' s nose .
i mean , i accidentally did that .
dave , you have a disease .
would you apologize if you were a diabetic ?
of course not .
why do you feel you have to apologize because you' re suffering from t. a. s. ?
t. a. s. ?
toxic anger syndrome .
i don' t have t. a. s.
he' s angry .
it' s a sickness , not a crime , fran .
his name is frank !
no .
i' m sorry .
clothes for cats isn' t really a new idea ... ... but there was never really a line made for overweight cats ... ... who might feel a little self conscious ... ... about how they look in certain outfits .
that' s why i got the baggy sweater on him , to cover up his gut .
and the beret to take attention off his plump head .
oh , little meatball .
you tie this up tight ... ... and away goes the chin .
i' m so handsome .
hey , dave .
this is your office ?
andrew .
what are you doing here ?
i played golf with frank .
he' s friends with my dad .
we' re members of the same country club .
really ?
i' ve been wanting to play golf with him a long time .
is it awesome there ?
it' s nice .
so , anyway , dave , how' s anger management going ?
who told you about that ?
linda' s my best friend .
there' s no secrets between us .
for the love of mike !
this guy' s your girl' s best friend ?
no .
i mean , i like to consider myself her best friend ... ... but andrew is her best friend friend , if that makes any sense .
you ought to golf yourself .
you look a little stressed out .
i gotta go .
bye .
well , well , well .
this guy' s got quite a basket on him .
really ?
i didn' t notice that .
do you really want the love of your life hanging around with a guy ... ... who looks as though he could satisfy a blue whale ?
well , it' s ....
i' m doing okay myself , pal .
maybe it' s the way his pants fit him .
what' s up ?
this is your young lady ?
that' s my linda .
my , oh , my .
i was toying with the notion that you were gay ... ... because of the kitty cat clothes , so forth .
what does she do ?
she teaches poetry .
poetry teacher .
i love poetry .

i' m more comfortable there .
he' s just not used to male intimacy .
well , that' s okay , because i' m a lady .
oops , no , i' m not .
whoa !
there it is .
i feel like dancing .
dancing .
oh , my god .

oh , are you an angry boy ?

no , thank you very
oh !
hey !
hey , watch that shit !

gentleman !
lentleman !

galaxia , you may get out of the car now .
your services are no longer required .

you guys are freaks .

come on .
patient number 135 , david buznik ... ... has learned the difference between unhealthy anger and righteous anger .
thus he has advanced to the second level of my program .
great .
can i go throw up now ?
i' m a lady .
oops , no , i' m not .
whoa , there it is .
i feel like dancing .
wasn' t that sick ?
she looked like olivia newton john ... ... if she was really ugly and had huge balls .
but buddy didn' t order you to have sex .
i' m getting a call .
please hang on .
hello ?
is buddy there ?
no , he' s in the shower right now .
this is becky , his assistant .
just tell him his mom called from boston .
she said she' s having some minor surgery .
it' s not serious , but she' il be at boston county hospital for the next two days .
miracles of modern science .
i am stimulating my hair follicles ... ... and brushing my teeth at the same time .
it looks really good .
what' s the matter ?
your mom .
they took her to the hospital , buddy .
what' s wrong with my mother ?
she' s having surgery .
i' m sorry .
is it serious ?
when is surgery not serious ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
you' re right .
maybe i better get up to boston ... ... see what' s going on up there .
yeah .
yeah .
why don' t you just go up there .
spend some quality time .
i' il stay here .
it' il be good for you guys .
oh , god .
you' re all i got , mom .
please don' t leave me .
no more clam chowder .
buddy ... ... it was a joke .
i' m sorry .
you don' t have to cry anymore .
a joke ?
yeah .
oh , boy .
a joke .
a jo i ....
i can' t believe that i fell for that one .
i really thought my mother was having surgery .
i' m going to get you back for that one .
just so you know , she really is having surgery .
i thought you said you were joking .
no , the serious part was the joke .
she' s having surgery , but just minor surgery .
maybe i better get up to boston ... ... see what' s really going on up there .
why don' t you ?
you just shoot up there .
i' il be here .
what ?
i can' t believe he' s making me go .
how come you guys aren' t flying ?
because dr. cocoa puff said legally i' m not allowed to get on a plane .
meanwhile , i' ve got head up my ass about that catalog .
i' ve got to get it done with nut boy in boston .
why can' t head write his own catalog ?
because i' ve got to earn that promotion .
you' ve been doing his job for years .
you should be his
i' m sorry .
i know this is really stressing you out .
i' m sure that it' s going to be over before you know it .
yeah , if i don' t get caught popping any jelly stingers .
well , that' s going to be tough !
oh , god .
there he is .
that' s him ?
yes .
what ?
oh .
okay , i' il hold that .
my
the quiet warmth
smoldering beneath the rituals of hope for familiarity
a coursing underground river
pregnant with the chance currents of knowledge and love
what ?
that' s my poem !
i wrote that .
i know .
that is your poem .
i love that poem .
i found it crumpled up behind the sports pages ... ... on the floor of david' s bedroom .
shades of early emily dickinson .
who was great on police woman .
thank you .
and thank you for rescuing it from the floor .
i think i better get going .
i' il miss you , big guy , so take good care .
how about a kiss ?
i' d love a kiss .
i think she' s talking to me .
i think i can handle it .
so why don' t you back up an inch or two .
got it .
thank you .
and , take care .
have a great trip , you guys .
oh , we will .
bye .
what ?
some mindless nitwit is parked behind me .
good .
then we can' t go .
no , i can get out .
get in .
i don' t know how you' il get out .
try to wiggle out , you' re going to get a ding .
but you know everything .
what' s he doing ?
well , you' re batting a thousand ... ... in craziness .
now we' re bumping into cars .
i' m just making a little room to back up .
if i had lost my temper ... ... would i have had the presence of mind ... ... to leave my card and my insurance information ?
whatever , mr. insane vein popping a little too far out of his head ... ... while swinging the bat guy .
i think you' ve got room to back up .
why haven' t you taken linda off the market ?
think you can do better ?
i' m going to ask her to marry me when i' m ready .
nobody wants to settle down with a 35 year old secretary .
procrastination , dave .
i' m not procrastinating .
i even think about how i' m going to pop the question .
husky down jacket .
husky eskimo look .
what' s your plan , ask her at a yankee game ?
actually , yes .
how did you know ?
i said the corniest thing i could think of .
if you knew linda , you' d know how uncorny it would be to her .
putting up a " marry me , please " on the scoreboard ... ... proclaiming my love for her in front of thousands of strangers .
as you seem to have noticed , i' m a little bit jumpy with public affection .
you seemed to be lovey dovey back there .
glad you think that' s funny .
i gotta work .
a five hour trip to find out mommy had a jelly bean ... ... removed from her nose .
i' m glad i missed work .
can we eat now ?
you could have her , you know .
i' m sure she' d love to hang out with a goofy secretary ... ... whose only talent is nostril wiggling .
girls love that .
dave ... ... you' ve got a lot more going for you than wiggly nostrils .
i want you to go over there and ask that woman out .
no , i got a girlfriend .
i' m not telling you to elope with her .
just go over and flirt a little bit .
flirting is cheating' s ugly cousin , buddy .
i' m not a cheater .
is it cheating if you' re passed around the cell block like a peace pipe ?
because that is what' s on the docket for you if you don' t go and ask her out .
okay , dave ?
oh , god .
that' s my boy .
excuse me .
i was wondering if i could buy you a drink .
i see that you have a drink ... ... but i could get you another when you' re through with that one .
bite me .
nice meeting you .
okay .
can you guess why she rejected you ?
she wanted to be like the 2000 other girls who said that to me growing up ?
no .
self hypnotic negative imagery .
confidence is the key to winning a young lady' s attention .
now , listen to me very carefully .
approach miss thing again .
no .
with confidence .
and if she says no this time ... ... i will admit that i am a failure as a therapist ... ... and release you from my program .
you' il release me from your program ?
i' m sorry i was so rude before ... ... but it' s difficult for me to express myself ... ... when i' m on the verge of exploding in my pants .
get out of here .
trust me , dave .
if you are calm as well as witty , she will respond .
witty went out the window with the pants explosion thing , thanks .
my offer stands .
so if i repeat that crazy shit ... ... you probably stole from a porno flick , you sick bastard ... ... and get rejected ... ... you' il release me from the program ?
exactly .
here we go .
go get them , mr. johnson .
i' m sorry i was so rude before ... ... but it' s difficult for me ... ... to express myself ...
... when i am on the verge ... ... of exploding in my pants .
you are too cute .
get the fuck out of here .
i' m kendra .
i' m dave .
let me buy you a drink .
can i get a cosmopolitan ?
hey , baldy , if i want crap out of you , i' il squeeze your head .
i didn' t say that , but i should have .
you are so funny .
too bad you' re leaving town .
we could have fun together .
unfortunately , i am leaving in the morning .
in fact , i think i gotta get back to my friend .
what' s the matter ?
you gotta be kidding me .
what' s wrong ?
my friend took off on me .
i can give you a ride .
i don' t even know where the guy lives .
we can hang out at my place until you get in touch with him .
i bet there' s like 50 rydells in here .
i shouldn' t eat this .
i' m getting so fat .
what ?
you' re not fat .
my clothes hide it , but i' m getting gooey right here .
i don' t see any goo .
you want to see goo , i' il show you my ass .
well , i see it , and i didn' t five years ago .
i went out with this guy , and he wouldn' t sleep with me .
and i asked him why , and he said that when he saw me without my clothes ... ... that i look like a porker .
he was probably just nervous because you' re beautiful and ....
anyways , you' re not a porker .
you' re the un porker .
you' re sizzlean .
you' re so sweet , dave .
well , you' re sweet , kendra .
thanks for having me here .
he said her name was rose .
rose .
rose rydell .
rose rydell .
rose rydell .
rose rydell !
i got it !
kendra ... ... even though i' d love to see you take that bra off ... ... because it represents a team i' ve hated my entire life ... ... i think you gotta keep it on .
why ?
because i got a girlfriend .
i' m not a child , dave .
if you think i' m a porker , then just come right out and say it .
no .
i don' t think you' re a porker .
then why when the idea of sleeping with me comes up ... ... do you all of a sudden have a " girlfriend " ?
because i do .
i do .
i have a girlfriend .
said the liar to the beached whale !
you' re not a beached whale .
if anything , you could even gain a few pounds .
so now i' m too skinny for you ?
no .
i didn' t mean that .
is this what you want , dave ?
no .
if i put on a few pounds ... ... will you be able to stifle your vomit long enough to have sex with me ? !
holy shit .
are you such a hot stud that you' il break me in two ? !
you' re angry right now .
wanna sing ?
do you know " i feel pretty " ?
get out !
get out !
stop !
get out !
get out !!
porker !
fatty !
no !!
how did it go , pal ?
why' d you ditch me ?
what are you talking about ?
you gave me the signal .
i didn' t give you the signal to leave .
i gave you the signal to say your gross pickup line actually worked .
well , of course it did .
so did little davey need some anger management ?
that chick was killer .
serial killer .
she tried to chocolate me to death .
anyways , i don' t cheat on linda .
speaking of linda , she called earlier .
oh , yeah ?
she seemed a little bit bent out of shape .
about what ?
your being out with another woman .
how would she know that ?
i told her .
what else could i do ?
what else could you do ?
you could' ve told her something else .
i was at the bank .
i was at the store .
i ate bad guacamole and i couldn' t stop shitting !
any of those would have been fine !
well , i' m sorry , dave , but i don' t lie for my patients .
you want to leave your friend and run off and chase some hot babe ... ... you can' t expect me to cover for you .
i did what you told me to do , you sick , demented man .
what are you laughing at ?
what' s so funny ?
kendra is an ex patient of mine , an actress .
pretty good one too .
i arranged for her to be in the bar and for you to pick her up .
you were messing with me ?
yeah .
you know , just a joke between friends ... ... like the one you pulled on me about my dying mother .
i told you i' d get you back for that .
all right .
so you really didn' t talk to linda .
of course i did .
that' s what made it so funny .
where' s your phone ?
she' s not home , dave .
she went out with her pal andrea .
she doesn' t know any andreas .
you mean andrew ?
yeah , that' s it .
andrew , the testicle with legs .
the testicle with legs . " great !!
now wait a minute .
calm down a bit .
try some deep breathing .
maybe just hum a little " i feel pretty .
no !!
how about you hum the " i' m a crazy asshole " song ?
and take me home , you psychotic piece of wacko .
i never thought you' d take it like this .
so , what , we' re not going to talk at all ?
would you forgive me if i told you i called linda last night ... ... after our little fracas and explained that it was my fault ?
what did she say ?
well , she' s not mad at you anymore , but she let me have it pretty good .
you deserved it .
i did nothing wrong .
i know .
i know .
friends ?
take a little nap .
i am tired .
well , you had a rough night .
stop with the cupcake !
rise and shine , sir snoozola .
what' s going on ?
where are we ?
well , at a great deal of expense and effort ... ... we have managed to locate your grade school bte noire ... ... arnie shankman .
we do desire a confrontation with him , do we not ?
what ?
do you mean the kid who bullied me in fifth grade ?
dave , i think it' s pivotal for you to confront your childhood nemesis .
remember , for 22 more days , you are mine .
this is where arnie shankman lives ?
you' re kidding me .
you' re going to make me confront a monk .
great .
are you ashamed that you never stood up to him ?
no .
he was just a kid lashing out ... ... because his sister got sent to an insane asylum .
i' m surprised your research didn' t tell you that .
this doesn' t look like him .
excuse me , arnie shankman ?
sorry about waking you up .
my name is pana kamanana ... ... but , yes , i was once known as arnie shankman .
arnie ....
pana kamanana ... ... dave buznik from elementary school .
david buznik .
this is the last place i thought i' d find you , a monastery .
you could say i' ve gone through a rather dramatic transformation .
could you excuse him for a second , peanuts ?
his name' s not peanuts .
it' s pana manapia .
you want me to fight a monk ?
he' s not even allowed to hurt a plant .
for pete' s sake , this is the monk that twisted your tits !
confront him or you' re going to prison !
all right .
all right .
all right .
anyways , what i wanted to say to you was ... ... when we were kids , you kind of bullied me around a little bit ... ... and i never really did anything to deserve that kind of treatment .
of course not .
i was a real cretin then .
i did a lot of horrible things as a kid .
i pushed you around .
i called you nasty names .
you pulled my gym shorts down in front of sara plowman .
that actually was pretty funny .
jeez , i don' t think that it was .
now , come , david .
humor is the spice of life .
the look on your face was priceless .
oh !
sara saw my pee pee !
so pena likes the spicy humor .
maybe he' d enjoy the knee slapper you told me about the great buddha .
what did you say about buddha ?
dave said , " how does a guy who weighs over 600 pounds ... ... have the balls to teach people about self discipline ?
let' s not make fun of my god , here .
you know what else dave finds particularly piquant ?
recalling your nut job sister struggling with her underpants ... ... in a straitjacket .
you think that' s funny ?
dave used to con her into getting naked ... ... by saying that her clothes had ghosts in them .
that never happened .
then he' d pull out his winkie and tell her ... ... it was a strawberry ice cream cone .
is that what you' ve come here to tell me ?
did you expose yourself ... ... to my sister ?
and don' t shove me again .
it' s shower room humiliation again .
he' s giving you a wet willie and making you chew on his jockstrap ... ... and fart blossom and all this .
answer me , buznik !
did you get it on with my sister ?
over and over again .
and she moaned like a wildebeest .
wildebeest .
whoo !
now , that felt good !
i wasn' t expecting that from a buddhist .
i' m a little pissed off right now .
you all right ?
you' re all right .
david !
david !
no , david !
easy , boy !
sorry .
help me , brother .
help me .
okay .
come on .
come on .
okay , we' re even .
we' re even now .
i went crazy .
i' m so sorry .
i started it .
i started it .
it' s all right .
and i' m gonna finish it !
now we' re even , butt lick !
no !
don' t !
don' t !
don' t !
what' s that , auntie em ?
it' s a twister !
my nipples !
pena !
look !
your sister' s back .
i got casper in my clothes !
pretty good .
thanks , baby .
i' il kill you !
you want that rake ?
you can' t get that rake from me !
look , everybody !
pana banana' s got a heinie .
he' s got a heinie !
i give !
i give !
all right .
i' m sorry .
friends ?
you suck !
shankman !
wedgie !
wedgie !
wedgie !
i' ve seen enough .
hold it right there .
this party' s by invitation only .
pow !
pow !
pow !
pow !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
hold it back there !
come on , come on .
start the car !
go !
go !
go !
come on , let' s go !
now !
now !
now !
now !
oh , boy !
we were like butch and sundance !
oh , my god !
i thought you were going to shoot somebody !
you really threw me some curves back there , kid .
i never expected it to go that way .
but you kicked some serious monk ass there , baby .
you' re damn right , baby !
how did it feel ?
i feel good !
i feel incredible !
i feel bad about molesting his sister all those times , but it' s all right !
you really molested a crazy girl ?
no .
got you .
congratulations , keed , you' ve reached level three .
i would never have done anything with that girl .
don' t worry .
dr. rydell explained everything to me , and i get it .
dr. rydell brought up an interesting fact about me being a procrastinator ... ... and i was going to wait for a yankee game to do this ... ... but ....
i don' t know .
i ....
it' s something i wanted to say to you ... ... and i' m having a hard time saying it for some reason .
but ....
it' s just that monks , they talk shit ... ... but they can' t back it up .
that' s what was so hard to say to me ?
you know , when i was on the phone with buddy , he gave me some advice .
that' s great .
his advice is a little cuckoo ... ... but somehow it works .
well , then i guess i' il just do what he suggested .
i don' t think that we should see each other for a while .
buddy thinks that a trial separation will ultimately ... ... strengthen our relationship .
now , fury fighters ... ... what keys do we need to possess before we can ?
dave .
you' re late .
can i talk to you alone , please ?
sure you can
you told linda we should have a trial separation ?
yes .
yes ? !
yes !
separating from linda is a crucial part of our strategy .
my strategy is to keep my girlfriend .
all right .
strictly as a friend .
linda' s been thinking about leaving you for some time .
she loves you , but she recognizes you' re a neurotic mess .
you' re jealous ... ... self ioathing , resentful , insecure and a premature ejaculator .
she told you i was a premature ejaculator ?
that part i was assuming .
i haven' t done that in , like , eight months .
anyway , a trial separation will make you both gain a deeper appreciation ... ... for david buznik .
after she dates a couple of losers , she' il be begging you to take her back .
so i' ve been thinking about it , linda ... ... and a trial separation is exactly what we need .
and if you want to start seeing ... ... other penises people ... ... i want you to feel free .
you sound upset .
are you all right ?
i' m fine .
just date anybody you' d like .
and don' t hold back , okay ?
because there' s a lot of nice guys out there and i' m cool with it .
i' il be strong .
so the guy asked me for change .
i laughed .
he cursed .
i whizzed on him .
what else could i do , huh ?
you should' ve tossed a rock at him .
that' s your solution for everything .
the guy' s homeless , right ?
let him be .
set your anger free .
look at you , lou .
you' ve really calmed down since working with dr. b.
we all have .
hey , fellas .
could you bring it down a little bit ?
we' re trying to have dinner .
the walls are really thin .
this is a free country !
what' s going on with you ? !
are you crazy ? !
go in !
just go in .
goosfraba !
goosfraba !
goosfraba .
very good .
what are you guys doing here ?
i need to see dr. b. i' m in crisis .
he' s not here .
why don' t you go look for him ?
davey , your girlfriend stopped by and she dropped these off for you .
those are her keys to my apartment .
i think your girlfriend' s cheating on you .
why ?
i heard her on her cell phone ... ... talking to a guy ...
... making a date .
i' m so sorry , dave .
andrew .
i' il kill that guy .
she ain' t cheating on me by the way .
we agreed to take a break .
she' s not taking a break from the old sausage , huh ?
sorry .
she' s meeting the andrew at mort' s on 86th street now ... ... if you want to go watch .
no .
no , i can' t do that .
we' re here .
both of you showed up ?
you like stacy better or something ?
it' s just that i want to go on a fake date to get my girlfriend jealous ... ... so i really only needed one of you guys .
well , now she' il be twice as jealous .
so do you know the guy she' s with ?
i think i might .
let me ask you something .
because of your profession you probably have seen a lot of them .
does size count at all , or is that just some weird thing guys think about ?
this is where gina and i always get into a heated debate .
i like them when they' re really big .
and i think it' s better when they' re enormous .
good evening .
table for three ?
may we take your coats ?
no .
we' re okay .
the girls are gonna take their coats off .
would you like a boobs ?
booth ?
actually , could you give us a table overlooking that table right there ?
sure .
right this way .
thank you .
oh , my god .
it' s stacy and gina .
who ?
nobody .
i' m so hungry i could eat you , dave .
yummy .
yummy .
let' s get wasted tonight .
definitely .
have fun .
lucky son of a bitch .
what ?
i can' t believe this .
excuse me .
linda .
i' m a little embarrassed .
i didn' t know you were going to be here .
i guess not .
are those your friends ?
i' m supposed to date other people so i figured i' d give it a try .
gina , can you stop sucking on stacy' s finger for one second ?
i want to introduce you to somebody .
stacy , gina , this is linda .
nice to meet you .
and i' d like you to meet my date .
ladies , this is buddy rydell .
look , dave , it' s buddy .
i see .
you know stacy and gina ?
yes , yes , i do .
we' re in dave' s anger group .
fury fighters !
well , gee whiz .
here' s your rmy , linda .
this is a bit awkward .
i mean , group members ... ... are not supposed to get romantically involved .
yeah !
i agree with that .
you know that .
i' d like to talk to you alone for a second .
there' s a rage control technique i' d like to go over with you right now .
of course .
excuse me
what ?
two of the usual , duke .
coming right up , dr. b.
you' re the biggest backstabbing piece of crap i ever met .
what are you saying ?
i' m trying to give you a hand .
it' s my job .
bullshit !
your job is to steal my girlfriend ? !
my job is trying to prevent mr. andrew ... ... from unleashing the whopper with cheese .
that' s right .
since you' ve been out of the picture ... ... andrew' s been burning up the wires night and day ... ... trying to rekindle those hotsie totsie nights up at brown u.
how would you know ?
you think i only tapped your phone ?
what was she saying ?
the good news is , i already launched a preemptive strike .
now the situation is contained .
you and i control the game .
how ?
i will be uncharacteristically aggressively boring .
i keep talking about myself , acting arrogant and obnoxious .
when linda sees what the dating world is really like ... ... then guess who comes out smelling like a white mushroom ?
you swear to me this will work ?
the ball' s already up in the air .
incidentally , nice move bringing the girls .
very strong .
come on .
i' il see you at home in a half hour , keed .
that' s 25 dollars , pal .
we don' t ....
where were you ?
it' s 1 : 00 .
when you hear what happened , you' il bow down and worship me like a god .
better be good .
give it to me .
okay .
after dinner , she insisted we go home .
so we hop on the bus
the bus ?
you took the bus ?
what happened to your car ?
i was way too smashed to drive .
i told her i didn' t want to waste money on a cab .
that did not go down well .
okay .
i like that .
so we get to her house ... ... we have some kind of a weird argument ... ... about the number of syilables in a haiku .
poetry garbage .
she said it was getting late , we kissed and i headed on home .
now , you say you kissed ?
it was nothing .
little five second kiss .
that' s all .
wait .
wait .
wait .
wait .
you' re having this horrible evening .
how do you end up kissing , again ?
i wish i knew , keed .
we were both pretty geezed up .
one second we' re fighting , and the next second we' re laughing ... ... and then just a quick 10 second kiss .
i thought that you said five seconds .
first it was a five second one ... ... and then a little break because my beard gave her a tickle .
she' s cute .
and then a 10 second frencher .
you had your crazy , corroded tongue in my girlfriend' s mouth ?
just a second .
just one second , dave .
dr. b , let it bip .
well , hello .
i shouldn' t really talk right now .
well , i suppose you' re right .
it' s got to be done .
who was that ?
linda ?
i' ve got some good news for you and some potentially upsetting news .
first , the good news .
i' m going to sign your papers .
you' re a free man .
let me hear the potentially upsetting news .
linda and i have fallen for one another .
pretty hard too .
i didn' t intend for this to happen .
it was no one' s fault , i guess .
it was just
wait a minute .
i figured this out .
you' re messing with me .
i wish i were , dave .
however , i did insist that we not go forward without your blessing ... ... because we' re best friends .
so , what do you say , dave ?
is it all right if i date your ex ?
welcome back , mr. buznik .
i am appalled by your assault on dr. rydell .
obviously , anger management has been a complete failure for you .
i' m setting a trial date for 3 weeks from today for attempted murder .
as for dr. rydell' s safety , i' m issuing a restraining order .
which means that at no time can you come within 500 feet of him ... ... or his lovely new girlfriend , linda .
court is adjourned .
coming , peaches .
are you kidding me ?
numb nuts , where' s the catalog for my fat cat clothing line ?
i said i' d have it by 3 .
okay .
get in gear .
i' m so sorry i' m late .
i hope you have it .
my presentation' s in two hours .
what' s this ?
your fat shit cat' s been sitting there all day .
don' t worry about him .
here you go .
i think you' re gonna like it .
it' s good stuff .
that' s a good picture , i think .
what the hell is this ? !
you keep telling everybody you created the husky cat line .
i thought you' d want your picture in there .
no ?
can i get two couches in my office ?
if friends come over , i want them to feel comfortable .
what office ?
frank was nice enough to give me some creative executive position .
you gave him the job that i wanted ?
he earned it .
why can' t you be happy for me ?
linda' s gonna be .
know something ?
i' m sick of you hanging out with linda .
she dumped you 15 years ago .
get over it .
i wouldn' t worry about me .
it' s your pal buddy who' s taking her to the yankee game tonight .
yankee game .
did he steal my proposal idea ?
buznik , your behavior is unacceptable .
unacceptable ?
i' ve been getting your coffee and doing your work for five years now .
when a good position actually opens up ... ... you give it to the biggest dick in the world ?
i don' t know about the world , but it' s definitely the biggest one in the room .
now , when i started here ... ... i was promised advancement opportunities .
and breaking that promise , to me , is unacceptable .
you see ?
i golf also .
you should bring me sometime .
so when i get out of jail , sometime in the next two to five years ... ... i expect you to give me the position that andrew just resigned from .
okay .
great .
have fun looking like colonel klink .
by the way , his name is not fat shit cat , it' s meatball ... ... and he' s eating your crab cakes right now .
you starting to get excited ?
are you kidding ?
i' m out of my mind .
this is going to be some night .
come on .
come on .
dr. b , how' s it going ?
very well , thank you .
always a thrill .
right this way .
where the hell' s a spot ?
where' s a spot ?
whoa !
watch it , man !
your attention , please .
your attention , please .
before tonight' s national anthem ... ... metropolitan opera star robert merrill ... ... will present a special moment for two special people .
i love when they do this .

ladies and gentlemen , robert merrill .
linda ? !

what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
wait , don' t i know you ?
come on .
where' s your german accent ?
you have me confused with somebody
i wanna get on the field .
i' m a fan of mr. merrill' s .
there' s no fans allowed on that field .
galaxia .

hebrew melvin' s in love .

i can' t stop love .

thank you .
don' t think i don' t owe you a couple smacks by the way .
good evening .
tonight , romance comes to yankee stadium .

i wanna borrow this for a second .
that' s my mike !
linda ?
where are you ?
don' t move .
linda ?
are you out there , honey ?
linda , i' m not mad at you .
oh , shit .
i know that crazy man brought you here .
davey' s going crazy !
i' ve done crazier stuff than that to win back a chick .
once i ran naked through a subway station .
how was that supposed to work ?
i guess i never really thought it through .
i gotta tell you something personal !
this kid lost his marbles .
i' m over here !
linda , think about what you' re doing to us .
sweet tackle .
wow !
dave just got leveled !
nobody messes with my microphone .
i' m sorry .
bob ?
everything all right , buddy ?
oh , yeah .
i' ve never seen you so excited .
it' s not every day a man gets to propose marriage ... ... to the woman he loves .
now , here' s what i want you to write on the scoreboard .
linda !
linda , i' ve loved you since the day i met you !
i won' t let you do this to us !
don' t marry him !
don' t marry him !
wait !
let this man finish what he came here to say .
let the man back in .
who was that guy ?
i think it' s regis philbin .
thank you , mayor giuliani .
you' re the man , by the way .
this clown better hurry up .
my arm' s starting to ice over .
chill , rocket .
goosfraba .
goosfraba .
goosfraba .
i can understand why you wanted to see other people .
i really can .
buddy rydell is a psycho !
but he was right about one thing .
i was an angry guy .
mainly angry at myself ... ... for letting people treat me like crap all the time .
but i don' t want to be that angry guy anymore .
i wanna change .
if you give me a chance ... ... i can show you that i got the guts to stand up for what i believe in .
and i believe in us , linda .
i love you with all my heart , and i know you love me back .
i should be your husband ... ... not that weirdo .
i want to have a family with you .
i want to have kids with you .
kids who have your eyes ... ... and your lips ... ... and my ... ... last name .
that' s all i wish on them .
please marry me , linda .
before i make my decision , you have to do something for me .
you have to kiss me in front of all these people !
you can do it , david !
give her a five second frencher !
kiss her , david .
kiss her , david .
kiss her , david !
kiss her , david .
go yankees !
dave' s a dirty boy .
that wasn' t so bad , was it ?
i can' t believe you actually started to fall for that crazy man .
buddy' s not such a bad guy .
congratulations !
you just graduated from anger management !
i' m glad your car died .
the train' s romantic .
don' t change the subject .
you' re telling me the past two weeks of my life was just therapy ?
well ....
yeah .
i met with buddy after reading his book ... ... and i told him about some of the things going on in your life ... ... and how upset it was making you and how nuts it was making me .
he said that he thought he could help , but it would be tough .
so how much of this thing was a setup ?
well , the guy in your seat on the plane , the flight attendant , the judge ... ... they' re all friends of buddy' s .
what about the air marshal who tasered me ?
was he in on it ?
no , he was just having a bad day .
son of a bitch .
skipper , how you doing ?
buddy rydell , you' re a great man .
i was just doing my job .
i never doubted you for a minute .
except when galaxia had ahold of you .
did you just call that guy buddy rydell ?
a guy named buddy rydell left this card ... ... on what' s left of my lexus !
oh , yeah .
for insurance purposes .
your insurance was canceled !
grenada !
don' t point that gun at buddy .
i' m the one who smashed your car up .
dave ? !
no !
i' m sick of guys like this .
you wanna mess with my friends , shoot me first .
don' t !
are you crazy ?
settle down .
butt out !
tough guy' s going to learn a lesson .
i' m not afraid .
dr. rydell taught me not to be afraid of anybody .
can i ask you a question , though ?
got you !
dr. b , davey just pulled a joke on us !
and how does that make you feel , lou ?
chuck .
we were just doing a joke .
that' s my friend .
are you okay ?
he feels stunning .
