that' s nykwana wombosi speaking in paris the day before yesterday .
he was an irritation before he took power ... he was a problem when he was in power and he' s been a disaster for us in exile .
he' s writing a book about the agency' s history in africa .
he' s going to name names .
it' s basically a shakedown .
he' s demanding the agency' s help .
he wants us to put him back in power in six months or else .
this interview , and i' il make the tape available to anyone who wants it ... he goes on to claim that he' s just survived an assassination attempt .
he says it' s us .
he says he' s got proof .
the director wants to know if there' s any possible shred of truth in this accusation .
i' ve already assured him there' s nobody that reckless on my senior staff .
i was recalling a conversation we had some time ago , talking about treadstone .
i seem to remember nykwana wombosi' s name might have come up .
i' m not sure what we' re talking about .
someone tried to take him out .
tried and failed .
was this treadstone ?
you' re asking me a direct question ?
yes .
i thought you were never gonna do that .
what happened ?
well , we , uh , lost communication with our man .
this was almost two weeks ago .
we' ve been working around the clock , the whole unit .
we' ve been sleeping down there .

and you don' t let me know this ?

i can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside .
i can tell that our waitress is left handed ... and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself .
i know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside .
