we all start off in life with a dream , don' t we ?
for a tennis player , it' s being in the final of the grand slam ... center court , a high lob , a smash .
game , set and match ... you' re a champion .
you' re number one .
but for most tennis players , that' s all it ever is ... a dream .
the reality is another story ... my story .
you see that good looking fella ?
no , not the kid in white .
the other , tired , good looking fella .
yeah .
him .
well , that' s me .
british davis cup a long time ago .
two singles titles even longer ago .
presently ranked 119th in the world .
sport is cruel .
now , i know it doesn' t sound too bad .
four million tennis players in the world , and i' m 119th .
but what that really means is this ... 118 guys out there are faster , stronger , better and younger .
and it gets you thinking .
you' il be 32 in ...
the prime of my life .
how long can peter colt keep playing this game ?
time to retire gracefully .
stop it .
stop it .
just serve .
these young guys ... where do they get the energy , the focus ?
no fear .
you see , the one thing you can' t have is fear .
and for the first time in my life , i' m afraid .
not oflosing .
i' m not even afraid of the kid .
i' m afraid of what happens if that ball keeps going by me .
what happens then ?
i hope you don' t mind , but i took the liberty of having it engraved .
wow .
exactly .
frankly , my biggest problem is parking .
right .
mm , not for you , of course .
no .
your own space .
nameplate again .
oh , good .
hello , ian .
is this the young man you were telling us about ?
mm hmm .
peter colt , the one and only .
once ranked 15th in the world , i hear .
uh , 11 th , actually , for the better part of' 96 .
yes .
peter' s got himself a wild card at wimbledon .
then we' re hoping he' il be hanging his racket here at the club .
well , we' il see .
we shall look forward to giving you a peek at our ground strokes .
won' t we , ladies ?
oh , do shut up , sylvia .
good luck at the championships , young man .
thank you very much .
yes .
carry on .
uh , peter .
peter .
watch the ladies .
occupational hazard .
of course .
oh , look at this .
look at this .
completely new hybrid .
yes , developed by the yanks .
firm but springy .
look , peter .
i can' t wait forever .
there' s no one else i' d rather ...
ian .
look no further .
you have your tennis director .
oh , that is splendid .
so splendid .
oh , look .
that' s peter colt , the new pro .
once ranked 17 th in the world .
eleventh !
i was ranked 11 th in the world .
what makes one tennis player different from another ?
it isn' t a killer forehand or serve .
lots of people have those .
but the great ones have something else .
some say it' s a supportive family .
others say it' s being hungry , really hungry .
but as you can see , i' ve never been hungry .
hello .
and as far as a supportive family goes ...
mum ?
dad ?
anybody home ?
hello , carl .
life still giving you trouble , is it ?
deep throat . " director' s cut .
absolute classic .
hey .
they' ve been at it like that ...
like cats and dogs ... for weeks .
you all right , dad ?
yes , yes , yes .
you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet ?
' cause , you know , i don' t wanna miss your grand finale .
interesting bit of trivia actually .
i' ve never won a match at wimbledon with my family in attendance .
we' re not invited ?
no .
she' s not gonna like that .
what won' t i like ?
hello , darling .
you' re looking rather gaunt .
thank you .
why is dad so upset ?
oh .
ridiculous man .
for some reason , he believes i' m having an affair with eliot larkin .
mother .
he saw you snogging in the club car park .
well , that would do it .
not in the kitchen .
i wanted your father to see us .
that was the point .
shake him out of his stupor , compel him to act .
i hear you' re planning to retire to babysit a bunch of old ladies .
not what your father and i had in mind all those years ago cheering you on .
and do you know why ?
because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player .
oh , god .
you' ve just always been afraid to admit it to yourself .
i' m not afraid .
i' m old .
oh , don' t be absurd .
thirty one is not old .
it is in tennis years .
i might as well be your age .
thank you , dear .
and i' m tired of hotels , and i' m tired of airports ... and long distance love affairs that never go anywhere and ...
losing ?
yeah , losing .
thanks , carl .
now tell her about the tickets .
tickets ?
oh , god .
you really are a wanker , aren' t you ?
harsh but fair .
why doesn' t he have the tickets ?
i mean , do you know why ?
what does he think ?
does he think we' re going to sit here watching it on television ?
dad , what are you doing up there ?
i should' ve moved up here years ago .
right .
well , i' m off up to wimbledon then .
righto .
peter .
yeah .
remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman' s game ?
yeah .
total bollocks .
everything i ever told you ... total bollocks .
right then .
welcome to the dorchester , mr. colt .
thank you .
you have a suite , top floor .
wonderful view .
really , i think you might have made a ...
thank you .
wow .
well , they weren' t wrong about the view .
you need something ?
yeah , i ...
i' m so sorry .
i was given the key to room 1221 .
this is room 1221 ... my 1221 .
oh , right .
your 1221 .
well , that makes perfect sense .
what makes perfect sense ?
you see , i' d reserved a more modest room .
now i' il go down to the front desk and ... thank them for this dreadful error .
good bye then .
yes , good bye .
and may i say good body ...
luck !
shit .
i meant ...
shit .
oh .
lovely kitchen .
this way .
see now ?
that' s much cozier .
yeah .
i get a lot of questions about my personal life .
i usually don' t answer them .
that' s why it' s called a personal life .
right .
i mean , i just want to focus on my game , you know ?
unfortunately ...
i have to agree with my dad on this one ... all that other stuff just gets in the way .
but , lizzie , you have had problems with chair umpires this year .
some of the players think you go out of your way to disrupt a match .
i really don' t .
i mean , you know , maybe i go a little over the top sometimes , but , you know , maybe that' s what i need to do to play my best .
and that' s why i came to london ... to win wimbledon .
we' il be watching .
good luck .
gonna knock ' em dead this year , peter ?
that' s the idea , danny .
i' ve got a strong feeling .
thanks , danny .
gonna knock ' em dead this year , ivan ?
i' il do my best for you .
i' ve got a strong feeling .
see you later .
hey , dieter .
you wanna go for dinner ?
afraid not .
there' s a chance i may get lucky tonight .
oh , really ?
intriguing irish girl .
her father owns much of dublin .
excellent .
she have a sister ?
only child .
tragic .
i should stay and work on my serve anyway .
this is my last hurrah .
i wanna go out in style .
well , that' s the spirit , old man .
bugger .
oops .
sorry .
wrong court .
forgotten me already ?
god , no .
you' re the lady with the lovely ... kitchen .
uh huh .
lizzie bradbury , right ?
and you' re ?
peter .
peter colt .
nice to meet you , peter peter colt .
five quid says you can' t do it again .
mm hmm .
ten bucks says you can' t hit two in a row .
you' re on .
lovely form .
thank you .
hmm .
you' re exceeding my expectations .
mine too .
do it with a slice serve , i' il treat you to fish and chips .
ooh .
the pressure' s on .
lovely toss .
fish and chips it is then .
lizzie , sweetheart , what the heck are you doing ?
oh , just one more serve , daddy .
you gotta be back in the hotel in 20 minutes for an interview .
two seconds , okay ?
it' s funny .
you don' t seem the " daddy " type .
hit this one , and i' il sleep with you .
i' m so sorry !
too bad .
you could' ve used the workout .
hello , and welcome to day one of the championships , where the players meeting on center court today ... include andy roddick , serena williams ... and britain' s best hope for a title , tom cavendish .
other brits in action include journeyman veteran peter colt .
and today marks the wimbledon debut of american lizzie bradbury .
we' il see if she can live up to her lively reputation .
what are you talking about ?
the chalk flew up .
there' s a mark right there .
the ball was out .
get on with it !
you know what , i' il let it go .
' cause you obviously can' t see it , and i feel sorry for you .
30 15 .
quiet , please .
40 15 .
yes !
how are you doing ?
what time' s your match ?
3 : 00 .
ajay bhatt .
you ever heard of him ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
he' s sitting over there .
look .
oh , my god .
shouldn' t he be off discovering masturbation or something ?
played him at bogota .
he' s like all young men ... out to destroy us , to kill the father .
and like all young men , he must first be taught the lesson ofhumility .
exactly .
and you taught him that lesson in bogota ?
sadly , no .
he killed the father ... straight sets .
watch out for his backhand .
twenty pound to win ...
ajay bhatt .
hold on .
hold on .
isn' t he playing your brother ?
you should be ashamed of yourself .
yeah , but , curiously , i' m not .
so this is it .
this is the end .
this is what it looks like .
1, 000 balls a day , 300 days a year , for 25 years .
six million balls .
and it all ends here , at 2 : 00 in the afternoon on court 17 ... while they' re over on center court screaming for the latest russian teenage beauty .
well , let' s see if i can at least make it last a little while .
ajay . !
come on , ajay . !
good luck , mr. colt .
thank you .
bhatt to serve .
first set .
right then .
play .
love 15 .
okay , nice .
not embarrassing .
another 71 like it , and you' ve got it in the bag .
oi . !
bloody rabbit . !
shoo . !
crowd cheering , announcer , indistinct ]
we have our first match point .
yes . !
come on .
i must say he' s playing with newfound confidence today .
yes .
so here we are ... match point .
yes . !
come on . !
get it . !
yes . !
good shot . !
well done . !
come on . !
come on . !
yes . !
that' s it . !
he' s done it . !
he' s done it . !
he' s through round one !
not interested .
what ?
not interested .
oh , suit yourself .
so you think that kid has a future .
yes , i do .
who beat ajay bhatt in his first ever grand slam ?
what wimbledon is this for you , peter ?
it' s my 13th actually .
and since this may well be my last wimbledon press conference , um , i' d like to take the opportunity to announce my retirement from ...
jake . !
please .
come on , man . tennis .
that' s my retirement from tennis ... effective the moment this tournament ends .
lizzie !
tomorrow morning , i want you at the rear entrance , 9 : 00 sharp .
we can avoid all of this , all right ?
yeah , you' re probably right .
excuse me , ladies , if you please .
come on , sweetheart .
hey , lizzie !
lizzie !
jake .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
how' s your injury ?
you have one new message .
congratulations .
you still owe me fish and chips .
uh , say , 7 : 00 ?
room 1221 .
that' s my 1221 .
oh , bollocks !
it' s open . ... kuiper belt appears tonight in the northern sky .
once mistaken for a shooting star , the comet gained its name ... from two u. s. servicemen on patrol in the south pacific .
it' s the first time in 67 years it' s appeared ... and will be visible to the naked eye for the next two weeks .
hi .
hi .
uh , two fish and chips , as promised .
um ...
what ?
let me just ...
oh , geez .
how embarrassing . get this .
are you hungry ?
um , not quite .
i' ve got a question for you .
all right .
where do you come down on the whole " fooling around before a match " issue ?
well , that' s a very intriguing question .
' cause i think a little fooling around can be really good for your game .
you know , help you relax .
um , i' m not sure i' ve done enough research to have a definitive opinion .
that' s very sad .
yes , it is , isn' t it ?
it is ... very sad .
don' t get me wrong .
i' m ... very interested in doing the necessary research .
are you ?
i' m interested .
peter ?
no one can know about this , okay ?
really ?
i had been planning a brief press statement .
seriously .
especially my dad .
he' s convinced , if there' s a guy around , my first serve gets mushy .
well , you can' t win wimbledon with a mushy serve .
no .
so ... we' il keep it light .
okay ?
absolutely fine with me .
we' il just keep it , you know , fun and ... relaxed .
relaxed .
good .
peter ?
excellent .
more research .
and that' s another point lost .
the truth is that dragomir ... seems to have completely seized control on this court , known as " the graveyard of champions .
for some reason , peter colt' s game this afternoon ... has been less than inspired .
oh , god !
oh , god , i' m tired .
i' m so tired .
of course you are .
stay up all night doing research , you' re bound to be .
game ...
dragomir .
what a pity .
dragomir leads five games to four in the fourth set and by two sets to one .
come on , peter .
hello !
do you mind ?
bugger .
he was doing so well .
i wouldn' t write him off just yet , pauline .
some young men , i find , have a stamina that' s ... really quite deceptive .
the second round .
that' s not so bad .
he did win the french open .
at least you got three games off him .
three games ?
three lousy games ?
last match of your career , and you got three games ?
time .
it' s pathetic .
come on , peter . !
well , at least there' s no one here to see you lose .
come on , peter . !
oh , great .
come on , pete . !
love 15 .
who would have thought , 40 minutes ago , that we' d be in a fifth set ?
but here , peter colt ... who hasn' t beaten a top 10 player in the past two years , remember ... is at 5 4 , three points from winning the match .
30 love .
you were with me last match .
yes , sir .
brilliant play , sir .
do you think i could trouble you ...
sorry .
40 love .
and we have our first match point .
out !
game , set , match ...
colt .
incredibly , the english wild card , peter colt , has defeated the french open champion to advance to the third round .
6 4 , 4 6 , 2 6 , 7 5 , 6 4 .
i thought i' d done my last one of these .
so did we .
so did we .
yeah .
peter , did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you' ve defeated in three years ?
yes .
uh , two months and 14 days .
but who' s really counting ?
what , uh ...
what do you think of your next opponent ?
truthfully , in all the excitement , i haven' t even checked to see who it is .
it' s your practice partner .
dieter prohl .
so two friends must now face each other as enemies .
an intriguing existential dilemma .
room 1221 , please .
right .
is your elbow playing up ?
well , if i admit to that , you may use it to your advantage .
wow .
that' s terrible .
is that what our friendship' s come to ?
dodgy shoulder maybe ?
the truth is , most everything aches .
what doesn' t , i can' t feel at all .
tell me about it .
hello ?
hello ?
mm !
we should still practice together .
we must stick to the routine .
the hotel offered me a better room .
i told them i' m on a roll at the moment and i' m not changing rooms .
at such moments , our superstitions are all we have .
exactly .
even when i' m taking a shit , i must do it exactly the same .
i' d never thought of that .
that' s genius .
you think of everything important ... you do it the same .
oh , wait a minute .
yeah .
oh , that' s okay .
put me through .
lizzie , listen , don' t say a word .
i was thinking a repeat of the other night ...
like fish and chips , early to bed .
sh ...
mr. bradbury , hello .
mr. bradbury ?
damn .
yeah ?
yeah .
peter .
billi .
come stai ?
you are the dragomir slayer .
how are you ?
you look a million ... lira .
oh , thank you , thank you .
i try .
do you know my partner , sophia ?
no .
hi .
nice to meet you .
so ?
i' m looking for lizzie bradbury .
have you seen her ?
no .
maybe you should ask jake hammond .
oh , really ?
why ?
why do you think ?
oh , right .
ah .
well , i' d better get a move on .
ciao .
good luck tomorrow .
thank you .
looking for someone ?
yeah .
ye yes .
wouldn' t happen to be my daughter ?
yes , it would .
it' s colt , right ?
yes , but please call me peter .
lizzie' s on a roll right now , and i don' t want her to have any distractions .
right .
of course .
s sorry .
just to clarify .
do you see me as a distraction ?
that' s exactly how i see you .
so stop looking for her .
stop calling her .
stop coming around .
stop every damn thing that involves my daughter .
is that clear ?
i suppose , in a few thousand years , the english will evolve webbed feet .
yes .
just about the same time the first german evolves a sense of humor .
no , no , no .
that' s unfair .
many times , i make you laugh .
no .
i' m laughing at you , not with you .
ha ha .
somebody wants you .
oh , you know what ?
i think i' il ...
i think you will too .
see ?
now that was quite funny .
yeah , i know .
hey , get some rest tonight .
i don' t wanna win too easily , what with you and that , what is it , bad knee ?
i have a little confession to make .
oh , god .
when you , uh , walked into my room the other day ,
i knew exactly who you were .
you did ?
mm hmm .
i saw you play tommy haas at the lipton last year .
oh , shit .
yeah .
you were ahead , but then you totally fell apart , remember ?
yes .
i recall the ball girl couldn' t get out of the way of my serve .
you gallantly carried her off the court .
i thought you were such a ... asshole .
to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully ?
i couldn' t get it out of my head .
i kept hoping i' d run into you .
until finally you walked into my hotel room .
like a knight in shining armor perhaps ?
no .
trouble is , i' m the one that needs saving .
yesterday , i was losing , and then i saw you watching .
what ?
perhaps my first serve' s getting a little mushy .
mm hmm .
this year' s love had better last
heaven knows it' s high time
i' ve been waitin' on my own
too long
when you hold me like you do
oh .
hey , look .
there it is , the comet .
see , with the little tail behind it ?
hardly anything , is it ?
barely moving .
we have to wish on it .
did you wish on your next match ?
it wouldn' t work if i told you .
who do you play ?
good friend of mine actually .
dieter prohl .
a friend ?
then you should know how to beat him .
what are his weaknesses ?
um , sausages , wagner , men in leather shorts .
in his game .
that' s why i gave up having girlfriends in tennis .
you have to dig extra deep to kill your friends .
now i have to kill him ?
without thinking twice .
and i don' t envy you .
why' s that ?
you practice together , you travel together , you practically live together .
do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon ?
because that is killing him .
it' s a bullet to the heart .
that' s what' s tough about this game .
there' s a winner , and there' s a loser .
and tomorrow , one of you is going to be a loser .
bloody pedals !
all right .
vij .
wh where the hell are the men' s matches ?
man , roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets , mate .
shit .
what about peter and prohl ?
didn' t hear ?
no .
straight sets , man .
pete decimated him .
tore him to pieces , man .
shit !
oh , what , you bet against him again ?
you know , that bastard usually comes through for me .
he' s been on such a good losing streak .
here .
are you , uh , peter colt' s brother ?
possibly .
i' ve seen you in here watchin ' the matches .
yeah .
you could say tennis is my life .
my passion' s chat rooms .
really ?
hmm .
broadband .
of course .
you may have humiliated the kraut , but you' re not done with him .
you change your routine not one iota .
i' m still your practice partner .
thanks , mate .
anyway , you know it was a hell of a lot closer than the score .
a let cord here or there , it would have been a different story .
bullshit .
you annihilated me .
you ...
you hit from the soul , the heart .
something' s happened to you .
something else , something ...
the girl in the taxi .
the the end of the waving hand .
that' s ...
that' s where the fire comes from .
admit it .
dieter , listen .
do you think that , in the middle of a championship ... and for the first time in years i' m actually winning ,
i' d be dumb enough to get involved with a woman ?
absolutely .
you have eight new messages .
well , aren' t i popular ?
peter .
ian frazier from the club .
well done . !
take as long as you need before you start with us .
oh , and the , uh ... the ladies send their regards .
you were incredible today .
i have a free day tomorrow .
i' il call you later .
peter , remember me ?
it' s your mother .
i hear congratulations are in order .
what did i always say about ya ?
i don' t know .
remind me , ron .
so , uh , cucumber and cucumber ?
and cucumber .
they forgot to put the sandwich in my sandwich .
what are you doing here , ron ?
you' re not still my agent , are you ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
what am i talking about ?
okay , well , i called you about a year ago , and i' m still waiting for you to return my call .
yeah , i' m into e mails now .
i don' t do the , uh , phone thing anymore .
ron ?
that' s a lie .
yeah , it' s a lie .
you want me to be completely honest with you ?
agents are not miracle workers .
we can' t sell a product that doesn' t exist .
but here you are existing again , so i' m back selling again .
you know what , ron ?
i genuinely despise you .
and you know what , peter ?
i really don' t take it personally .
because this could all be over by monday .
cavendish is a serve and volley guy , and you' ve always played shit against them , so i' d like to capitalize now if that' s not a problem with you .
i don' t want you to go down in history ... as that english guy who beat his best friend , the german guy , only to get beat by the other english guy .
i' d like to put some money in your pocket .
you got a problem with that ?
you' d have to cut your commission .
okay , look , unfortunately that' s a no go area .
everybody pays 10 % .
say five percent , or the next offer' s four .
you know , success has really changed you .
and i' m loving it .
screw it .
you got a deal .
besides , i have a funny feeling that cavendish is going down .
tea ?
yes .
i' d love some .
now let' s get down to business .
slazenger' s having a cocktail party this evening , and everybody' s dying to meet you for the very first time ... all over again .
i have a thing later .
i' il call you back .
i' il ring you tomorrow .
that' s fine .
tomorrow' s fi ...
lizzie .
ronny .
there she is .
how they hangin ' ?
fine .
and yours ?
fine .
who' s your new friend ?
you going to introduce me ?
you haven' t met yet ?
hi .
i' m lizzie .
peter .
peter colt .
the " peter peter colt ?
the one and only .
oh , i' ve heard a lot about you .
oh , really ?
nothing good , i hope .
that you' re a man who' s not afraid to come to the net .
i hear that this is your first wimbledon , and you' re gonna go all the way .
every chance i get .
well , well , well .
if this works out , do i get the , uh ...
you can have 10 % of our kids .
the kids .
that' s a ...
are you all right ?
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you come along and play matchmaker ?
did i do that ?
i' m sorry .
i just got excited by the math .
let' s just have a drink .
we can talk over this whole nike thing , and you' il still have her home before she turns into a pumpkin .
one day , none of this will be ours .
oh , no .
asshole incoming .
4 : 00 .
lizzie , what' s the deal ?
i' ve left you , like , half a dozen messages .
oh , really ?
how about that ?
hi .
do you know peter colt ?
yeah , we did meet once .
first round , san jose , last year .
exactly .
a memorable match .
yeah , which i , like , won .
peter' s in the quarters .
did you hear ?
wait a second .
are you screwing him ?
you know what ?
you are , aren' t you ?
i don' t believe this .
listen , my friend , we don' t want ...
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what are you , grandpa , ranked , like , 120 ?
i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors , but you really are a cheap little ...
oh !
jesus !
that really hurts .
but you did it so well .
are you all right , sir ?
i' m fine .
i' m fine .
good night , jake .
hey , yes , don' t get up .
leave me alone . !
i' m fine . !
that' s the first time i' ve ever hit anybody in my whole life .
lizzie ?
lizzie !
other side .
other ...
i' ve never had anyone fight for my honor before .
i kinda like it .
jesus christ !
you' re not safe to be with .
wait till you see me drive .
so , these are the wild streets of my youth .
the drugs , the sex , the milk shakes .
my parents live here , and i still keep a flat .
oh , so we can stay there tonight .
yeah .
but what about your dad ?
aw , let him find his own place .
parents are such a responsibility .
i know .
they' re worse than children .
oh , definitely .
my parents got divorced when i was 13 .
my mom was always on the road trying to be a singer .
what went wrong ?
she couldn' t sing .
so mainly my dad brought me up .
mine are still together .
which proves that love' s not just blind , it' s bloody stupid .
it' s sad .
everything they used to love in each other now seems to drive them crazy .
i can' t imagine ever wanting to get married .

i meant ...
you said " leslie . " who' s leslie ?
as you can see , we' ve , uh , we' ve had to fire the builders due to creative differences .
and truthfully , peter' s had a little bit of a liquidity problem .
oh , my nan liked to drink .

i' il ...
i' il see you at practice in the morning .
everything all right ?
everything' s great .
aren' t we gonna have a workout ?
i thought we just had one .

i usually do 10 miles .
why are you running behind me ?
i' m just enjoying the view .
snip by snip
i' m oozin' it bit by bit yeah
i' m takin' it step by step
boy , here and now
we' re caught in a moment
and i won' t let it go
and the silence it belongs to you and i
hey , look at that .
this is where my dad taught me to play tennis .
huh .
look at it now .
it' s a shame .
yeah .
ace !
come on .
make a little effort .
ace !
what' s the matter with you ?
are you scared of a girl ?
there' s something i haven' t told you .
what ?
this is my last tournament , no matter what happens .
but you' re doing so great .
hey , you just have to ...
keep winning .
right .
so keep winning .
oh , finally .
colt returns with a somewhat demure crosscourt forehand .
ah . !
colt makes a smashing return .
with unladylike effort ,
bradbury strains to get to the ball .
oh . !
it' s an extremely high lob .
will he maintain his gentlemanly composure , or will he ... dare i say ... win the point ?
hold on .
what' s happened to the ball ?
look .
gotta go .
good bye .
hundred quid on cavendish in the quarters .
hold your horses .
so , still bettin ' against your brother , are ya ?
it' s tactical .
if he loses , i get rich .
and if he wins , i get laid .
where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway ?
photojournalism .
i trust you slept well after your night of debauchery with young master .
i declare , i surely did .
good .
so did i. god .
no wonder the english never win wimbledon .
i' d love to see an english guy in the finals , but give me a break .
peter colt is the luckiest man in tennis .
oh .
wanker .
god , it' s incredible how much that actually looks like your dad .
oh , shit .
incredible how much that building ...
shit !
shit !
quick . !
hide . !
oh , carl !
you bastard !
oh , hello .
mr. bradbury .
where' s my daughter ?
she ...
gone , sadly .
sadly , gone .
she had to go and work on that first serve .
i expect she meant to meet you at the practice courts .
are you bullshitting me ?
absolutely not .
i' d never bullshit you .
i wouldn' t dream of it .
so , how was your trip down ?
the traffic can be murder getting out of london .
we left early .
well , the early bird does catch the worm .
uh , wou would you like a cup of , uh , tea ?
maybe something stronger .
a shot of whiskey .
a shot at me .
it' s peter , right ?
yeah .
look , peter , i got nothing against you personally .
you seem like a nice guy , and , uh ...
oh , good .
i' m not an idiot .
i know that lizzie likes to ... have her fun .
and it keeps her relaxed .
um , if you were just another easy ...
you know .
well , that would be one thing .
but you' re not , are you ?
as a matter of fact , i was incredibly easy .
no , no .
this time , it' s different .
she' s ... falling for you .
oh , i see .
which is a total disaster .
but why ?
she' s hardly lost a set .
i ...
look , her footwork is off .
her serve is a mess .
she' s gotta get her head back in the game .
she' s gotta remember what it is that she wants .
and what do you think that is ?
what we' ve been working towards all these years , what she' s always wanted more than anything .
i still want it .
oh .
hi .
i want to win wimbledon .
i' m sorry .
that' s all right , sweetheart .
well , we' d better get going .
we got a lot of work to do .
you' re gonna go ?
yeah .
he' s right .
i' m sorry .
wait a second .
lizzie ?
lizzie . !
lizzie , this is ridiculous .
you' re a grown woman , and you should be making your own decisions .
this is my decision .
we can be together after the tournament .
after the tournament ?
what does that mean ?
you can' t just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb .
i' il call you at the hotel .
she won' t be at the hotel .
what ?
i' m sorry , kid , but ...
if you' re together , she can' t play .
tom . !
tom . !
tom . !
well , this may be an all british affair , but tom cavendish is clearly in control of the crowd and the match today .
he' s up a break in the first set , and peter colt ... with the expectations of an entire nation upon him ... seems to be withering under the pressure .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
40 love .
so that' s set point for tom cavendish .
linda , to the patio door .
well , talk to sergei .
she hits short , you come in .
daddy , stop bugging me .
she' il never pass you .
i' m focused .
i know the game plan .
yeah , right .
he' s out of my head now .
it' s over .
stop freaking out on me .
oh , yeah .
it was definitely his ankle .
you can see how he landed right on it .
this is ugly .
cavendish . !
cavendish . !
cavendish . !
peter colt may havejust got himself a free pass to the semis .
think you can go on ?
not so fast , chrissy .
listen to the crowd .
they worship the kid here .
the question is , will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish ?
he' s never shown much of a killer instinct .
quiet , please .
40 love .
there' s your answer , john .
look at that smile .
watch out , tom cavendish .
can we take another route ?
her match is at 3 : 00 .
i doubt it .
it' s a chocker .
what' s the score , sweetheart ?
it' s match point .
game point .
he' s done it . !
peter colt has done it again . !
another upset .
another seeded player goes down , and colt will now take on fifth seed pierre maroux in the semifinals on friday .
congratulations , my friend .
thank you , but i think my countrymen hate me .
what ?
i' ve just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship .
oh , ridiculous .
everyone loves a winner .
everybody but the british .
thank you .
see , i was right .
everything' s good .
everybody loves you .
almost everybody .
30 all .
what do you think makes her so extraordinary ?
no embarrassment , no fear .
she makes a decision , she goes for it , all pistons firing .
it' s a turn on for the rest of us ' cause most of the time , let' s face it , we' re all scared shitless .
even you , ron ?
me ?
i hate making a decision .
like right now , i' m very , very afraid .
if you don' t see that girl again , it' s going to mess with your head , screw up your confidence .
on the other hand , i' m terrified ...
i' m petrified that if i tell you where that girl is camped out , her father' s gonna fire my ass .
where' s the girl camped out , ron ?
32 kensington place .
first floor apartment .
i made a decision .
game ...
miss bradbury .
miss bradbury wins final set .
me too .
oh , shh .
shh .
no .
no .
hi .
shh .
now , listen .
it' s not what you think , so don' t start ...
i' il jump .
i' il jump .
i will .
you want that on you conscience ?
thank you .
lizzie ?
lizzie ?
lizzie , it' s me .
shit !
hey !
shut up !
noisy little shit .
oh ...
that hurt .
bugger !
peter .
yeah .
what are you doing here ?
that' s an excellent question .
that sad fact of the matter is , i can' t seem to get through 24 hours without you .
i missed you , peter peter colt .
you have ?
but i need you to go .
no , you need me to stay .
peter .
lizzie .
people have fallen in love before , you know .
oh .
is that what we' re doing here ?
good thing you didn' t get the wrong room .
i did , but your dad' s a very quick shag .
good morning . !
bbc london 94 . 9 .
the lark' s on the wing and everything' s for the best ... in this best of all possible worlds , ' cause it' s semifinals day .
which means it can only get better as peter colt stares down the racket of pierre maroux .
game point .
whoa . !
peter colt must have had his wheaties this morning .
he' s off to a roaring start .
but remember , chrissy , the last time these two met ... was in ' 97 u. s. open semis , a day i' m certain peter colt wants to wipe from the memory banks .
no kiddin ' .
it was the greatest opportunity of colt' s career .
he was up two sets , and then he completely choked .
and i don' t think he' s ever fully recovered from it .
you know , john , choking can be instigated by the smallest thing .
absolutely .
you wake up in the morning , and something just isn' t right .
or maybe a little superstition you have goes wrong .
and a seed of self doubt is planted .
lizzie . !
i love you . !
then everywhere you look , that feeling of doubt seems to be looking right back at you .
once that happens , all it takes is one point .
one decisive point that can make or break your confidence ... and completely determine the outcome of a match .
game ...
miss rupesindhe .
advantage ...
colt .
well , there' s no trophy here today on number two court .
peter colt is firmly in control .
thank you .
and incredibly , just two points away ... from the wimbledon final on sunday against america' s jake hammond .
come on , pete . !
quiet please .
that was an almost impossible passing shot .
match point .
yes !
and he seems to be having trouble getting up from that awkward tumble just now .
peter colt' s clearly in pain .
shit .
it' s hard to tell .
this could spell disaster for the man who' s captured the hearts ...
come on , son .
come on .
come on .
pick yourself up .
you can do it .
mr. colt , are you okay ?
it' s my back .
can you get up ?
i' m not entirely sure .
one more point .
come on .
he can' t actually hear you .
oh , yes , he can .
this is an eerie echo of the tom cavendish match .
well , he' s back on his feet .
oh , yes , he can .
well , only he knows how much it' s hurting him .
oh , my god !
the stress .
how does he deal with it ?
how does who deal with it ?
oh , my back !
my back is killing me .
but remember you' re one point away from the finals .
i' d love to see an english guy in the finals , but give me a break .
do you remember australia ?
your shoulder was killing you , and what did you do then ?
all right .
all right .
all right !
peter colt is the luckiest man in tennis .
this is gonna hurt .
game , set , match ...
colt .
6 2 , 6 1 , 6 3 .
yes !
i knew he could do it .
who would have bet , two weeks ago , that the man time had forgotten ,
rabbit .
caught it messing with your lettuce .
good man .
congratulations , peter .
can we just do a quickie ?
no , not right now .
how' d she do ?
it' s just one of those days where i couldn' t do anything wrong , and lizzie just couldn' t do anything right .
that would include accepting defeat , which ms. bradbury found very difficult today .
bugger .
it' s not as if she can blame you , is it ?
i told you i needed to focus , to be away from you for just a few days .
but , no , instead you sneak into my room , you don' t even have the decency to spend the night ...
i had the earliest start , and i thought you' d want the extra sleep .
i was some chick you picked up .
well , this chick is going back home to work on her serve .
lizzie , i am sorry about your match .
i really am .
but please don' t go .
because you need to screw me before the finals .
that' s why you think i' m here ?
it' s not .
really , peter ?
not even just a little bit ?
aha . !
you see ?
i know you want me to think ... that we' re falling in love or some bullshit , but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning .
that is absolutely not true .
oh , yes , it is .
and you know what ?
i love winning too .
more than anything .
more than anyone .
don' t say that .
you don' t mean it .
i do .
love means nothing in tennis .
zero .
it only means you lose .
she' s dropping her arm too soon after the toss .
honestly
can i say what i mean
don' t you play with me
' cause i' m a lady
you must clear your head .
you must forget about her .
love is shit , just like she said .
yeah .
he' s absolutely right .
just ask my soon to be ex wife .
ask all my ex wives .
thanks for the words of wisdom , ron .
shouldn' t you be off sucking up tojake ?
i took care of that at breakfast .
you gave her a taste ofher medicine .
you' re in the finals .
it' s time to move on , same as she would .
i don' t want to move ...
feel that ?
ow !
i' il take that as a yes .
look , i' m not making any promises , but if you keep relatively still , you should be in a decent state for the finals .
yes . !
we got it .
frito lay .
what ?
you are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip .
surprisingly zesty , it' s called .
that' s you , pal .
oh , god .
i' ve gotta get out of here .
no .
no way .
you heard the good doctor .
let' s get you some room service .
i would kill for another dozen of those ... what do you call the ... those little cucumber sandwiches ?
cucumber sandwiches .
you brits got a name for everything , huh ?
and in other news , the kuiper belt comet armstrong flynn ... finally disappeared from view today after blazing for nearly a ...
there' s a distance between us
and you take the blame
i know that you tried but at this stage of the game
i' ve started a new life
there' s no turning back
why , jennifer ?
will you now don' t you know
can' t you see i get over
sometimes i wonder
where this feeling began
deep in my heart right from the start
right from the start
tired and lonely
i move on from this pain
i' m starting again
i' m breakin' the chain
yeah , all right .
i' m going .
i' m going .
oh , for god' s sake , carl .
carl !
for god' s sake , what ...
didn' t i tell you always to knock before entering a room ?
well , it' s a bit late now .
you better come in and have some breakfast .
what do you want ?
eggs and soldiers ?
oh , eggs will be fine .
sit down .
morning , son .
where' s the marmalade ?
well , uh , i' m out of the tree house .
yeah , you certainly are .
your mother and i seem to have found some common ground at long last .
oh , really .
what' s that ?
you , peter .
you' re , uh , probably aware that things have been a bit sticky for the last few , well , years actually .
the fact is that , uh , in the end , the only thing we shared was the downstairs toilet , and she wasn' t really keen on that .
i think what i' m trying to say is that ... we' d forgotten just what an inspiration you are to both of us .
that' s meant to be the other way around actually , i know .
but how very proud we are of you .
it' s been a long time since we' ve done this .
too bloody long .
dad ?
hmm ?
my back .
oh , god .
well , it' s been quite a fortnight , hasn' t it ?
not just for peter , but for all of us .
i , for one , will admit ... and that' s not a word i like very much .
but we could all do better ... to love and support each other unconditionally .
without judgment , without ...
for god' s sake , carl , stop biting your fingernails .
you' re not a bloody infant !
augusta !
you were saying , darling ?
yes , i' m sorry .
i just wanted to propose a toast .
to the family .
our family .
it' s a trick .
our family .
our family .
oh , bloody marvelous .
no , darling .
we' re bad luck .
if we came and you lost , i would never be able to forgive myself .
i don' t believe in luck anymore .
listen , win or lose , and i can' t see how i' m possibly going to win , tomorrow will be my last professional tennis match .
and i can' t imagine the three of you not being there .
so , please .
so what you' re saying is jake' s the safe bet then .
good morning .
it' s radio 1 at 7 : 00 .
i' m chris moyles .
so today' s the day .
it' s the big finals .
peter colt , what an amazing man .
who would have thought ?
i didn' t think he was gonna do it .
now , i' m starting to think ...
morning , everyone .
bbc london 94 . 9 .
and it' s here .
it is wimbledon finals day .
i' il try to be detached , i try to be cool , but i' m carried away .
come on , colty . !
good luck , mr. colt .
thank you .
thank you very much .
all the best , mr. colt .
thank you .
thanks very much .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you so much .
thanks .
thank you .
thank you very much .
an englishman in the final .
fantastic !
if you could win that cup , sir , we' d all be so proud .
i' il do my best .
and i don' t even like tennis .
ready , sir ?
yeah , i think i am .
peter colt , seen here in his teens , has already declared this to be his last competitive match .
and what an exit .
only a matter of days ago ,
colt had become no more than a fading blip on the radar of tennis history .
now he' s become the man who ...
not to add the pressure , peter , but you know the entire united kingdom is cheering you on today .
yes .
well , let' s hope i don' t disappoint them .
did you have any realistic hope two weeks ago that you would be here today preparing to walk onto ...
lizzie , i love you more than life itself , but i can' t turn off every goddamned television set in the united kingdom .
i' m going for a walk .
flight board' s in half an hour .
what do you attribute this remarkable run to ?
you were supposed to make a very early exit .
well , i had a bit of luck against tom cavendish in the quarters , and i played a more focused game ... passionate game , uh ...
i suppose the real answer to your question is , uh , well , love really .
love of the game ?
yeah , love of the game .
um ...
but , listen , you may have read about lizzie bradbury and myself ... being involved , so to speak .
but , um , i' d like to take this opportunity to set the record straight .
i read the papers this morning , and , uh , they seem to imply ... that lizzie had let me down in some way .
that' s just not the case .
the truth is i let her down .
i let her down , and for that ...
i' il always be truly sorry .
listen , i' m not in the habit ... of pouring my heart out on television .
i' m not really in the habit of pouring my heart out at all .
lizzie , sweetheart , something i think you ought to see .
i' m seeing it .
so if this comes out wrong , forgive me .
lizzie bradbury .
lizzie is the reason that i' m here today .
that' s all i really came here to say except thank you .
thank you , peter .
i , uh , have a new theory of our life of tennis .
tell me .
oh , it' s simple really .
you hit the ball back over the net ... as hard and as deep ... and as often as possible .
sorry to disturb you , peter .
the members have invited you to use the number one dressing room .
oh , no .
thank you , danny .
i think i' d rather stay here .
right .
that' s what i told ' em you' d say .
good luck , my friend .
in a few minutes , colt and hammond will be making the walk ... through the tunnel onto center court .
a little stroll , chrissy , that i' m sure you' d agree is about the number one highlight of a tennis player' s career .
except for the butterflies i always felt , absolutely .
no , he can' t just wear the hat .
no , we don' t ' cause we don' t have an endorsement deal .
that' s why .
well , then he knows the number .
peter .
i tried to warn you about her .
by the way , how' s the weak back ?
it' s fine .
thanks .
how' s the weak mind ?
gentlemen .
fuck a duck .
jake hammond has been on an absolute tear .
he' s lost only one set this entire tournament .
and look who he' s had to beat .
hewitt , federer .
well , with the exception of dragomir and tom cavendish ,
colt' s road to this final has been a relative pushover .
right .
but he' s played some great tennis .
but my guess here is that he' s more than a little overmatched today .
first set .
hammond to serve .
i gotta go .
peter !
peter !
peter !
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
ready .
play .
15 love .
yes , thanks .
i' il be needing that .
he said , " thanks .
i' il be needing that .
quiet please .
go , jake !
come on , jake .
30 love .
40 love .
oh , that poor kid . !
he was on the receiving end of one of the fastest recorded serves in professional tennis .
144 miles per hour .
well , we certainly hope he' s all right .
and that reminds me how lucky i was , chrissy .
i ball boy' d in the old days when they used wood rackets .
and things were a lot slower .
oh , you bastard .
it' s one thing to humiliate me , but you didn' t have to mess with the boy .
now you' re going down , you bastard .
or maybe not .
colt to serve .
love 15 .
love 40 .
game ...
hammond .
40 love .
game and this set ...
hammond .
30 love .
game ...
hammond .
new balls , please .
love 15 .
hammond leads five games to two .
game ...
hammond .
love 30 .
15 30 .
15 40 .
peter colt finds himself once again at break point .
he really can' t afford to go down another break this early in the third set .
he seems completely lost out there , john .
lost and confused .
we may be witnessing ... the near total collapse of a player' s game .
at a moment like this , chrissy , you have to wonder ... what the hell is going through peter colt' s mind .
please , god .
please make it end .
game ...
hammond .
play suspended .
what are you doing , lad ?
get in here .
it ain' t over till the handshake , lad .
danny , i' m not really in the mood for a pep talk right now .
well , you better get ready for one .
hi .
i thought you' d gone .
yeah .
me too .
having a tough day ?
well , you know , disastrous .
except for the fact that you didn' t go gooey when the ball boy got hit .
yeah .
sorry .
why are you british apologizing all the time ?
don' t apologize to me .
i love you .
apologize to the people who are rooting for you out there .
what' d you say ?
i said that the whole country has been waiting ...
no .
no .
the other bit .
i said i love you .
see , that' s very good news .
i thought i was alone in the love department .
well , turns out you' ve got company .
i am so sorry .
if you say sorry one more time , you' re going to be sorry .
i meant about the other night .
shh !
stop it .
forget about that .
this is about you .
go out there and decide who you are .
and who might that be ?
that might be a winner .
please be patient , mr. hammond .
please sit down .
the question is , where' s peter colt ?
did he flee the building with the rain ?
i think he' s in the lavatory .
isn' t that a comfort break ?
is it ?
yes .
they are allowed one .
if he' s got a jumpy tummy .
so , if he doesn' t come back ...
he' s gonna lose .
of course i want to win .
i do .
but he' s just better than me .
no .
he' s not .
i' m two sets down .
my back' s killing me .
you' re going to play through the pain .
i' m too tired .
my legs are like lead .
find a second wind .
it' s what winners do .
his serve is unstoppable .
no , it' s not .
it' s a bundle of tells .
what ?
his serve .
it' s like a book .
you just have to know how to read it .
you know i really don' t care who wins .
i mean , i represent both players .
it' s like asking me which one of my kids i love more .
which one of my kids do i love more ?
my daughter .
i' il talk to you later .
well , peter colt is back .
let' s hope he' s better .
so far this match has been a blowout .
yeah , pete !
peter !
ladies and gentlemen , as play resumes , hammond leads ... two sets to love and one game to love .
hammond to serve .
play .
go , pete . !
ifhe bounces the ball once instead of twice , he' s going for the body .
ifhe shifts back on his left heel and shows you his toe , it means he' s hitting deep .
colt sure seemed to have hammond' s number on that one , chrissy .
which is a good sign ifhe' s gonna climb out of the giant hole he' s dug himself .
ouch .
you all right ?
yeah .
welcome back .
same to you , sir .
station ident ready to roll .
eight , top of your shot .
we got a visitor .
john , did you see who just came in ?
that' il give an immediate adrenaline burst .
yes !
he did it , chrissy .
he pulled out the set .
oh !
yes !
after a great comeback in the third set , colt' s game has leveled .
and he and jake hammond are even at 5 all in this tie break .
so , john , this next point is crucial ... if colt wants to keep this comeback alive .
come on , peter !
okay .
5 5 in the breaker .
here we go .
6 5 ...
hammond .
jake hammond is up 6 5 in the tie breaker , and he' s finally gotten himself a championship point .
this could be the final point of peter colt' s pro career .
right here , right now .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
this could be it , chrissy .
i if his heel moves left , he' s going right .
or is it the toss ?
yes .
i i if he tosses high , i it ...
oh , sod it !
6 all .
incredible point .
i' m doin' a complete 180 on peter colt .
this is amazing persistence from thejourneyman player .
i was already thinking about gettin' to the airport .
we may be going to a fifth set , and if i was jake hammond ,
i' d want to close this thing out right now .
the last thing he wants is another set with the momentum going in the other direction .
okay .
first one to win by two .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
7 6 ...
colt .
wow .
a double fault .
now it looks like hammond' s the one who' s getting tight .
peter colt now has set point to force a fifth and deciding set .
aw , give us a goddamn break !
please , shut off all mobile phones .
thank you .
yeah .
unbelievable . !
we' re gonna play five . !
advantage ...
colt .
rising star peter colt has battled back .
game ...
colt .
peter colt san .
game point .
colt leads five games to four .
final set .
well , colt has broken jake hammond .
and after this changeover , he' s gonna be serving for the wimbledon title .
listen , an hour ago , i didn' t think he' d find anybody to give him a ride home .
no question , john .
and now it' s all up to him .
i mean , he' s finally got a chance to serve out the match .
time .
break you right back , asshole .
did you see that ?
that is some definite gamesmanship from jake hammond .
come on , peter .
15 love .
come on !
peter colt is now three points away from winning wimbledon .
one point at a time , peter .
one point at a time .
it' s just another point .
it' s just another point .
like hell it is .
you could be the champion of wimbledon , which means you wouldn' t have to take the pro job for starters .
you could buy a new place , redecorate .
lizzie could help with that .
oh , god knows what taste she has .
oh , shut up , you silly ponce .
30 love .
make that two points away , chrissy .
come on , peter . !
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
come on , pete .
30 15 .
chrissy , we talked about colt' s reputation in the past ... as a choker when it comes to big points .
well , this is primo choke time .
i wouldn' t be surprised if colt got real tight now .
thank you .
it' s my fault .
peter . !
peter . !
peter . !
don' t choke .
don' t choke .
don' t choke .
don' t choke .
please don' t choke .
please don' t choke .
don' t choke .
i' m not gonna choke , damn it .
40 15 .
peter . !
do you believe it ?
peter colt is serving a championship point .
quiet please .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
championship point .
right then .
out .
40 30 .
i don' t believe it .
that was a terrible call for colt .
no !
what the hell ?
what ?
look at the chalk fly .
the ball was definitely in .
it was on the line .
it was on the line !
i' d be torching the stadium about now .
excuse me !
the ball was good .
40 30 .
oh , come on .
the ball was good .
chalk flew up .
the whole stadium saw it .
i don' t know if you' ve noticed , but it' s quite an important point .
that' s too close for me to overrule .
please resume play .
absolutely not .
i' m not playing .
this is complete bollocks .
absolutely bollocks .
code violation .
unsportsmanlike conduct .
warning , mr. colt .
in . !
in . !
in . !
oh , my ...
okay , here we go .
peter colt has his second chance now to win the championship .
the question is , can he do it ?
after a call like that ... a lot of players , including yours truly , would have a hard time getting back in the mind set .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
that serve wasn' t even close .
it wasn' t fast either .
i believe you to be a truly great tennis player .
ultimately disappointing .
total collapse of a player' s ...
stop it .
you have to stop it .
now .
yes !
he' s done it . !
he has done it . !
thejourneyman has won . !
a wild card entry .
ranked 119th in the world .
now champion of wimbledon . !
call letterman .
call leno .
call oprah .
call kimmel .
it' s utter pandemonium here .
i' ve never seen anything like this in my life .
the brits finally have a winner .
what' s wrong with you ?
you bet on jake ?
i bet it all on you , bro !
can i retire now , mum !
certainly not !
augusta !
well done , son .
we love you .
he seems to be lookin ' for somebody else .
i think the whole world knows who he' s lookin' for .
there' s so much i want to say to you .
i' m not going anywhere .
oh , yes , you are .
you' re going a long , long way .
nothing could possibly match that moment .
it' s everything you wait a lifetime for .
that dream finally come true .
what else could ever come close ?
except this , maybe .
i did take a job at a club .
but teaching young kids like my own , not old ladies .
yeah !
and i love it .
i beat you .
i beat you .
rubbish .
the ball was in .
it was definite ...
ow !
well , most of the time .
you see , a part of me was always afraid that my life would be over if i wasn' t playing tennis .
but the truth is , it was reallyjust beginning .
oh , and by the way , lizzie did win the u. s. open .
and wimbledon .
