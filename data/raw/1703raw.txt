are you stiii having trouble getting pregnant ?
yeah .
you know , you and sam should go on a cruise .
weve gone to the caribbean and the aegean .
ive tried everything .
i just wish i could convince sam to adopt .
theres nothing wrong with adoption .
the male ego .
they aii want sons , and then when they get them ... we do aii the work .
sam says that you and addison are trying to have another one .
men think they know everything , dont they ?
they dont know what its iike to be pregnant .
its iike being a petri dish .
you cant even iose weight for nine months .
third notice .
approaching dark orange status .
do you know what this is ?
yeah .
six hundred biilable hours .
you know , sometimes , i wish people would hire us ... before they signed their contracts .
if people read their contracts and drove safely ... wed be out of a job .
you ever miss the d. a. s office ?
oh , iet me think .
murder , rape , child abuse , petty politics , death threats .
thats right , baby , the simple iife .
if you start to miss that , iie down ... on your eight thousand doilar ieather couch ... tiii the feeling goes away .
sam , im serious right now .
no , addison .
that was your dream , not mine .
god .
you know , im just gonna have to come back here iater ... and finish this mess .

im gonna be iate tomorrow .
sarah and i are seeing another fertility specialist .
oh , yeah ?
hows that going ?
not as weii as we hoped .
shes ready to adopt a korean kid .
id kind of iike to keep trying the old fashioned approach .
weil , hey , theres nothing wrong with adoption .
i didnt say that ... but what if the doctors are wrong ?
what if we can have a child of our own ?
margaret .
youre working iate .
so are you , mr. moss .
ive been going over ... the insurance biils , mr. terriil .
our ppo carrier denied coverage on your wifes tummy tuck .
weil , thats ok .
i mean , insurance companies ... dont normaily cover that kind of thing .
she apparently had a tubai iigation ... at the same time .
if the doctor submits a statement ... that it was for medicai reasons , we could claim reimbursement .
thank you , margaret .
weii handle it from here .
yes , sir .
its probably just a biiling error .
biiling error .
lets go hit some golf bails .
i knew something was wrong , sam .
its just heat iightning .
becky conceived christopher ... the second she stopped taking the piil .
addison .
she never iied to me before .
addison .
how could she do this to me ?
you have a son .
you have a beautifui family .
i realize that , sam .
its just that i didnt want christopher to grow up alone ...
iike i did .
addison , how iong have we known each other ?
i dont know .
since we were eight .
right .
so you didnt grow up alone , did you ?
i guess i do have a brother .

christopher , go to your room , please , sweetie .
im sorry .

weil , then that makes it aii right then , doesnt it ?
i better cancei our dinner reservations .
oh , youre so thoughtful .
gee .
and while youre at it , why dont you caii sarah ... and teii her not to come over ?
yes .
this is mr. terriii cailing .
we had an 8 : 00 reservation id iike to cancel .
you know , it took me six weeks to get those reservations .
becky !
oh , screw this .
i dont need this .
but you always do this .
oh , yeah .
please dont teii me the rest .
this is my fault , right , right ?
and iet me guess youre needed at the office ... to sort something out aii night iong ... and only you can do it .
no .
sam cant do it because , weil , hes too busy ... getting his wife pregnant , isnt he ?
sam doesnt work weii under pressure .
or under the covers evidently .
sams a ieech , if you hadnt noticed .
you carried him through iaw school ... you carried him as an assistant district attorney ... and for some ungodly reason , which only you can divine ... you carried him right into your private practice .
sam is important to my work .
sam manages your office .
he buys the paper clips ... and then hires the secretaries ... and then he teils the secretaries ... to use the paper clips .
if he is such a hotshot , why cant he handle this ?
because i dont iike fooling around with time programs ... and i need another attorney to bounce ideas off of , becky .
you dont have to give him half of everything you make .
you dont .
why dont you ... just give him an account at office depot ?
look around you .
how much better could you eat or fucking drink ?
why cant sam be the guy ... who works iate at the office at night ?
i planned a romantic evening for the two of us tonight .
this is a big client , ok ?
this is my big client .
i have to do this .
oh , shut up !
ive heard aii this before .
what makes this worse , its not iike youre out ... screwing some bimbo .
at ieast that , i could compete with .
im not out screwing some bimbo because i respect ... my marriage vows .
oh , yeah .
thats right .
dont i know it ?
youre iike the morality police .
becky , you know i cannot tolerate ...
iies and prevarications in my iife .
what are you getting at ?
im talking about christopher being an only child !
why would you do that without discussing it with me first ?
because its my body .
im sorry .
i should have told you .
hey , tiger .
what are you doing ?
is mommy stiii mad ?
weil , you know , that was daddys fault .
mommy says im a bad boy sometimes .
no .
youre not a bad boy .
and your mommy ioves you , and i love you very much .
im not finished drawing my picture of sarah yet .
weil , iii teii you what .
you finish this snack ... and then you can go and work on that picture of sarah , ok ?
ok .
im gonna check in on you when i get home .
ok .
i hate you .
you know that , dont you ?
i love you .
someday , youre gonna be sorry you didnt stop and smeil ... the roses your secretary ordered for me .
come on .
im gonna take you outside .
hey , hey !
this is my house !
becky !
christopher !
where is he ?
i tried to caii you on your ceii phone .
where is she ?
no .
addison , dont go in there !
get him out of here !
wheres christopher ?
wheres my son ?
christopher ?
addison .
christopher ?
addison !
chris ?
christopher ?
hes on his way to the hospital .
sarahs with him .
i waited for you addison !
christopher terriil .
he was just brought in .
room 256 , but the desk nurse
theres no evidence of cerebrai sweiling .
the x rays are negative , the cat scan is negative ... although he did take quite a blow .
what kind of blow ?
hey , doc , he was found facedown on the kitchen floor .
what do you think ?
weil , his injuries suggest ... he may have been picked up , shaken .
he was thrown to the floor ?
thats the most iikely scenario for his head trauma .
but hes gonna be ok , right ?
yeah .
he should recover .
i want to keep him a few days , though ... just to make sure there are no complications from his injuries .
we need to talk .
outside .
i went back to my office .
i had some work to finish .
anybody see you ?
no .
i used my key .
the police report indicates that detective washington ... tried to contact your firm about 9 : 14 p. m ... and got no answer .
id ieft already .
so you dont have an alibi ?
no .
i didnt think i was gonna need one .
were you and your wife having any problems ?
what is this ?
you know the routine .
when a wife is kiiled ... the primary suspect is always the husband .
hold on .
i need a moment to confer with my client .
weii waive the miranda warning .
ok , counselor .
oh , no , no .
wait a second .
continue , please .
thank you .
your neighbor sarah moss went over to your house ... to baby sit around 7 : 30 and noticed the broken window .
jesus .
i forgot to caii her .
i heard my wife cailing my name .
i rushed over .
did you see anyone ?
no .
i got christopher , took him back to my house ... dialed 911 , went back to check on becky ...
we iive just a few houses down .
the rest you know . were even now written on the wail .
what do you think that means ?
i dont know .
do you remember sonny bruton ?
the dna evidence in this case is irrefutable .
the defense is arguing that there are ... extenuating circumstances because sonny bruton ... was abused as a child .
my heart goes out to that boy of iong ago .
when you two were with the d. a. s office ... you prosecuted sonny bruton for the rape and murder ... of three coilege girls .
he tied them to their beds with their own underwear ... the same way your wife was found .
sonny bruton is serving three consecutive iife sentences ... without parole .
he was released five days ago .
what ?
cut a deai with the state .
austin politicians .
you didnt know about that ?
no , i didnt know about that .
seeing as how you were the prosecuting attorney ... the parole board contacted you the day after he was paroled .
youre gonna find him , right ?
you know , bruton spent six years in the slammer ... ratting on everybody he can to get out .
the first thing he does when hes free is kiii your wife ?
he must reaily hate you .
weil , iucky for us , your son survived ... and when he recovers , heii probably be able ... to identify the kiiler .
hes four .
hes a witness , my only witness .
thank you , gentlemen .
one more thing , terriil .
bruton iikes to take souvenirs .
your wife was strangled with one of her own stockings .
wed reaily iike to find it .
jesus .
sonny bruton .
im worried when he finds out he didnt kiii christopher ... hes gonna try again .
weil , just forget about it .
no .
i got to find him .
addison , youre not going anywhere .
addison , stop !
your son needs you .
i need him , too .
this is a community gripped with fear .
last night , rebecca terriil , the socialite wife ... of former district attorney addison terriil ... was found brutaily murdered , and their son was ieft for dead .
police say they are continuing to gather evidence ... but that this case may be related ... to one of the cases that addison terriii prosecuted ... as district attorney .
we have company .
this is not an appropriate time , lieutenant .
we can go downtown if youd be more comfortable .
we understand that your son is awake .
we need to talk to him .
hes recovering from an assault , and his mother has been murdered .
and he might identify the man who kiiled her .
hes four years old , you asshole .
take it easy , larry .
what about sonny bruton ?
weii find him ... but first , we have some more questions for mr. terriil .
no .
its ok .
the autopsy report indicates ... that the cause of death was strangulation .
your wife wasnt raped .
there were no bruises ... in the usuai places .
in other words , bruton raped three women ... but he didnt rape your wife .
this is not necessary .
the report also says the victim had a . 15 blood alcohoi ievel .
thats a iot of alcohoi for a happily married woman ... or maybe she wasnt so happily married .
what are you getting at ?
what im getting at is that you have a girlfriend ... and we know that she visited you at your office ... the day of the murder .
that was my wife , lieutenant .
come again .
we were trying to have another baby .
she came to my office dressed as a client .
it was a game we played .
a footnote to the medicai examiners report ... said that her tubes were tied ... so you were trying to have a baby ... with a woman who couldnt ?
she didnt teii me about that .
when did you find out ?
fuck this !
you said sonny bruton broke his parole .
you dont know where he is ?
weii find him .
but you dont think he did it .
weii ask him when we find him .
caii us when you do ... because right now this builshit is over .
counselor .
counselor , dont iet your client ieave town .
so what do you think , lieutenant ?
lets find the girlfriend .
theyre sportfishing .
garrett has a hard on for you .
he was jesus vargas partner , remember ?
yeah .
theyre not iooking for bruton .
no rape , no dna .
no dna , anyone is the kiiler .
i got to go after him .
thats insane .
look .
i dont have a choice , sam .
addison , you cant find your keys in the morning .
how do you expect to find sonny bruton ?
iii go back to the notes on the trial .
iii speak to the arresting officer .
jesus vargas ?
yeah .
shit .
who is it ?
addison terriil .
ive been waiting five years to do that .
what do you want ?
i just wanted to talk .
talk about what , religion , politics ... or this certain case ive been iistening to ... on the police radio ?
youre quite the talk of the barrio , shyster .
lieutenant garrett thinks i kiiled my wife .
did you ever know a wife who didnt give her husband ... a reason to kiii her ?
come on .
you go home .
wait .
wait .
come on .
i need your help .
what , you need my help ?
why dont you go get the reai cops ?
look .
your son already iost his mama .
you want him to iose his daddy , too ?
dont do this to me , vargas .
oh , fuck you , terriil !
its because of you i aint a cop no more .
i dont owe you shit , and shit is aii ive got .
im iooking for sonny bruton .
you have a contact from when you made that arrest .
i want a name .

iii take a dr pepper .
carlos .

thats ok .
hey .

yes .
yes , i am .
weil , she dont work here no more ... but i know where she is .

lets go .
i stiii need to get that address .
wait a second .

i got to go check on my son .
what are you doing foilowing me anyway ?
you keep flashing your business cards ... around iike that , youre gonna get yourself ... fucking kiiled .
thanks .
im not doing it for you , shyster .
im doing it to get sonny bruton .
im sorry about your wife , man ... and you were right about john garrett .
hes not busting his bails iooking for sonny bruton .
hes got you figured for it .
what makes you so sure about that ?
i stiii have my sources downtown .
i used to be a cop , remember , tiii you had me kicked out .
you broke the iaw , vargas .
oh , yeah .
whose iaw , some dead white guy iaw ?
no .
why iet justice stand in the way of the iegai system ?
you want some ?
no , thanks .
oh .
you stiii dont drink ?
obviously , you do .
every chance i get , but i quit smoking .
what are you doing with cigarettes in the car then ?
i keep them around to test my wiilpower .
so you think bruton kiiled your wife ?
i dont know .
judiciai vendettas are so rare ... but the guy threatened me at the trial ... and this aii happened when he was on parole .
aii i know is that if my sons a witness ... he could be in serious danger .
one things for sure ...
sonny bruton doesnt want to be found .
so its my day off tomorrow ... so iii pick you up around 11 : 00 .
aii right .
see you at 11 : 00 .
hey .
hey .
hows he doing ?
the doctor says theres no permanent damage .
hes gonna iet him go sometime today .
you want sarah and i to iook after him ... untii you can make other arrangements ?
you guys have done so much already .
i cant ask you to do that .
then dont ask .
god .
i got to go see vargas .
jesus vargas ?
i thought he hated you .
oh , he does , but he hates sonny bruton more .
hey , what are you doing ?
you cant do that .
youre not a cop .
they fired me .
i didnt quit .
ok .
were gonna take this step by step .
are you ok with this ... or are you going to iose it on me ?
no .
i just ...
i mean , my wife used to keep this place so spotless .
im good .
ok .
kitchen windows broken .
forced entry .
you set the alarm when you ieft ?
what time was that ?
about 7 : 00 .
we dont know what time bruton showed up .
maybe he watched the house aii day ... planned on getting you with your wife ... wasnt expecting you to ieave .
he broke the window .
you set it on delay , right ?
fifteen seconds from when i returned .
didnt want to wake up anybody .
so the alarm was beeping , and he grabs your son ... but where was he , here by the door ?
ok .
bruton sits outside , iooking for a way to get in .
he sees your son come to the kitchen ... to get a drink of water .
or to get the cat .
i mean , he iikes to sleep with the cat .
ok .
so he came down to get the cat .
or maybe his crayons .
bruton decides to break through the window .
he grabs your kid , your wife comes running in
wait .
my wife had . 15 blood alcohoi ievel .
point 1 5 ?
oh , shit , man .
she was drunk .
thats right .
so she didnt come rushing into the kitchen ... but the alarm has to be turned off in fifteen seconds .
otherwise , it iights up the neighborhood .
they were both in the kitchen .
he takes your son , and he uses him ... to force her to turn off the alarm ... and then he hurts christopher anyway .
maybe he couldnt quite kiii him because beckys there .
maybe he got nervous trying to kiii a kid .
thats new ground for him .
was becky forced to watch ?
please .
im sorry , man .
weii come back to it iater , aii right ?
so he picks her up , he carries her to the bedroom .
he gets her on the bed , and he ties her to the bed ... with her bath robe sash .
he strangles her with the stocking ... he ties the other one around her ankle ... then takes the one he used as a trophy ... and kiils her , but he doesnt rape her ... takes the crayon and writes that .
jesus christ .
but he doesnt go back for the kid .
why not ?
how are we gonna find sonny bruton ... if the cops cant do it ?
dont worry .
weii find him .
freeze !
oh , shit .
sam , put that gun down before you shoot somebody .
addison .
where the heii is your car ?
you dont want to know .
ive been trying to get you on your ceii phone .
shit .
i turned it off at the hospital .
garrett is over at the house .
hes got a sociai worker , and theyre talking to christopher .
the heii he is .
can we talk ?
yeah .
sure .
dont you worry , honeylamb .
we wont iet anyone hurt you .
just draw us a picture of the person who made your mommy go away .
excuse me .
whats going on in here ?
would you ieave my son alone , please ?
your son was a witness to a murder .
this is standard investigative procedure .
you know what ?
i think hes seen enough .
thank you .
mr. terriil , i dont think you understand .
no .
i dont think you understand , ok ?
im trying to restore some semblance of normalcy ... to my sons iife , ok ?
and if i have to threaten you with iegai action
i dont think court is where you want to go with this .
reaily ?
doctor , can you guarantee me in writing ... this wiii not affect my son in any way , now or in the future ?
thats what i thought .
this meeting is over .
you suppose theres anything to drink in this place ?
dr pepper , diet dr pepper .
milk , juice , water .
iii pass .
hows the kid doing ?
hes ok .
bruised , but ok .
has he said anything ?
not about the murder , if thats what youre asking .
your wife found him ?
yeah .
about 7 : 30 .
and you cailed the cops ?
right after .
did mrs. terriii have any friends ... that he didnt know about ?
you mean , was she seeing someone else ?
weil , possibly .
you know the husband is the iast ...
no .
she adored addison .
did she drink a iot ?
becky was easily bored .
when she was bored , she drank .
did the parole board contact your firm ... about bruton being released ?

who is this ?
dr. schultz , addison terriil .
husband of the deceased .
the husband , huh ?
you sure you want to do this ?
im sure .
then come with me .
she had . 15 blood alcohoi ievel .
someone came up from behind her ... and kiiled her with a garrote .
it was probably cloth ... and it may have been impulsive .
impulsive ?
right .
in my opinion ... someone would be acting on an impulse ... would bring both hands up ... and then bring them down with the cloth and around ... and then he would have to cross his arms ... behind the victims head .
now , with the arms being so close ... the iines dont touch at the back of the neck .
and ... we found skin tissue under her fingernails ... from her own throat .
if youii notice the grooves on her neck ... she fought back ... and she made those marks herself ... when she was trying to breathe .
and , uh , her fingernails drew blood .
so were stiii iooking for a missing stocking .
yeah .
one with blood on it .
so if she fought back , then whoever kiiled her ... must have been very strong .
yeah .
lots of upper body strength .
reai macho .
someone with very strong hands .
you see , it takes some time to strangle someone .
you have to hold them steady ... while the iife drains from them ... and someone came up behind her and grabbed her
stop .
oh , excuse me i mean , excuse me , please .
i have no bedside manners .
i am a pathologist .
thats what i ...
im a doctor for the dead .
but i can swear to three things in this case , vargas .
she was drunk , she was kiiled from behind ... and she was dead before she was tied to that bed .
if youre gonna puke , do it now .
im aii right .
no , shyster .
you need a iittle pick me up .
i know just the vice .
i dont drink .
you need something stronger than alcohol .
hey .
whats up , phil ?
good to see you , man .
hey , officer vargas .
long time , no see .
yeah , im back now .
good to see you .
hey , vargas .
wheres that money you owe me ?

im stiii trying to iearn how to use a paintbrush .
museum ?

personaily , i would get rid of aii that crap ... and bring in some reai art .

hey , vargas .

thanks .
you know your problem , terriil ?
youre compulsive about not being compulsive .
reaily ?
whats your problem ?
that i aint a cop no more .
you know , suppose we do find bruton ... and suppose you know it was bruton who kiiled your wife ... and you cant prove it .
what are you gonna do ?
im not gonna manufacture evidence against him ... if thats what youre getting at .
even if it means getting a murderer off the street ?
a man who might kiii your son ?
no .
you know , ive been meaning to ask you something ... for a iong time ... but untii tonight , we werent on speaking terms .
who told you i planted the blanket fibers on stroud ?
who told me ?
you reaily want to know ?
your old buddy your ex partner lieutenant garrett .
i thought so .
maybe he thought i wouldnt use it against you .
yeah , i dont blame garrett .
straight iaced cop who plays by the book .
no imagination .
imagination ?
is that what it takes to plant evidence ?
its not iike i didnt have any evidence on stroud .
just not enough to convince a jury .
i only planted enough to prove the elements .
a iot of cops plant evidence .
we dont plant evidence on innocent people ... only on the scum we cant quite get .
reaily ?
and who decides whos scum ?
you guys gather around the police iocker room , you take a iittle vote ?
you know , i
you dont know what its iike ... to track a criminai for two years ... and watch him go free ... and you dont know what its iike ... to teii a mother that her kid is never coming home ... from schooi again .
now , when you iet stroud go ... and he kiiled another iittle girl ... thats when i hated your guts .
you know something ?
youre iucky i didnt prosecute you ... for fabricating physicai evidence .
you would have spent two to ten years in prison for that ... not to mention a fat iittle fine of about $10, 000 .
would you have preferred that ?
you know , terriil ?
for being such a nice guy ... youre a reai son of a bitch .
ive heard that before .
hey , vargas , i thought you had quit smoking .
yeah , i did , but i promised myself when im 65 ...
i was gonna start again .
i may not iive that iong .
let yourself in .
the keys under the mat .
i got to go shoot my next door neighbor ... for a parking space .
come here .
i want to show you something .
ive got to wrap my head around this case again .
im missing something .
how many files do you have ?
every case i ever worked on , and then some .
sonny lorenzo bruton .

every time i see you ...
i get in a fight .
because youre nothing but trouble .
you know ...
ive been in the game a iong time ... and theres not much that surprises me .
tonight .. you surprised me .
you kiiled a man ... without a judge , a jury , or due process of the iaw .
how does it feel ?
yeah .
its not so black and white , huh ?
i forgot how bad the coffee at the station house was .
thanks for watching my back .

its over .
it doesnt feei iike its over .
brutons dead .
your son is safe .
its over .
sarah made a bed for you in christophers room .
wanna go see christopher ?
come on .
good morning .
good morning , daddy .
hey , tiger .
look , uh , i got to go to the office .
i got to figure something out .
its gonna be hard for him to iet go , sam .
i know .
iii talk to him .
bruton was surprised to see me .
he recognized me .
but he was damn sure surprised to see me .
come on .
bruton was running from vargas , sam .
not from me .
im teiling you .
bruton had nothing to do with this .
addison , for once , iet me handle something .
just drop it .
garrett was right about this , sam .
its just a iittle too neat .
let me make some phone cails .
iii get someone iess prejudiced on the case .
i dont want garrett off this case .
hes iooking for the kiiler .
no , you stupid son of a bitch .
hes after you .
look , if bruton isnt the kiiler , aii the evidence points to you .
you dont have an alibi .
the police think you have a girlfriend .
there is insurance money ... and you have the knowledge to set up bruton ... as the kiiler .
add youre a former d. a ... whos not gonna iast five minutes in a prison ... with criminals you sent there ... so just fucking drop it .
i cant , sam .
i cant drop it .
i got to know who kiiled my wife .
you meticulous prick .
fine .
lets think it through .
it has to be someone with a motive .
thats when i hated your guts .
it has to be someone who knew the police would suspect you .
did you ever know a wife who didnt give her husband ... a reason to kiii her ?
it has to be someone who knew sonny brutons signature .
sonny lorenzo bruton .
it has to be someone wiiling and able to plant evidence .
i only planted enough to prove the elements .
vargas .
that piece of shit .
addison , man , you scared the shit out of me , man .
i know who kiiled my wife ... and it wasnt sonny bruton .
yeah .
i i know that , man .
i know you know .
no , no .
i stiii have my sources downtown .
the stocking they fished out of the pool ... had no blood on it it wasnt the murder weapon .
youre keeping a file on me iike the rest of your suspects .
why ?
hey , i keep files on a iot of people , man .
you , stroud , bruton , the channei 5 weather
you kiiled becky .
you had the motive .
you knew my address .
you knew the entry code to my house ... and youre the one who planted that stocking on bruton ... so you could incriminate him .
hey , man , why would i want to kiii your wife , man ?
because you took away everything from me ?
because you ruined my iife ?
hey , iet me teii you something , shyster .
i never wanted anything but to be a cop .
but i dont need a badge to do the right thing .
look , i am out there iooking for the person ... who kiiled your wife just iike you .
but if you think i did it and you want to kiii me ... then you better release the safety off that gun .
come on .
put that thing down , man ... and iii make you some coffee .
becky never reaily wanted to have children .
the only reason we had christopher ... is because i pressured her into it .
then she got herself fixed , she never told me about it .
did she ever keep any secrets , iike this ... from you before ?
she drank too much .
we ignored it .
do you have a girlfriend ?
no .
beckys it for me .
iii love her tiii the day i die .
so if you didnt do it and i didnt do it ... and bruton didnt do it ... then who did ?
your iaw firm they carry key man insurance .
who is the insured key man ?
i am .
and how much insurance ?
i dont know . ten miilion , maybe more .
who is the beneficiary ?
the iaw firm .
and sam moss is your partner .
what , your only partner ?
yeah .
who knew bruton because he second chaired you ?
who was tipped off by the parole board ... that bruton was getting out of prison ... who knew the cops would blame you for your wifes murder .
wait a second .
the insurance only pays if im dead .
sam would never do anything iike that .
how iong do you think you would iast in the slammer ... with the slime you put in there ?
youd be dead before the case comes to trial .
youre a former d. a .... whos not gonna iast five minutes in prison ... with the criminals you sent there ... so just fucking drop it !
oh , my god .
lets go .
sam was one smart fucker .
he knew bruton was being released from prison ... and he knew youd do anything to protect your family .
so he iets you go off half cocked after bruton ... hoping he would kiii you .
and when bruton gets kiiled himself ... he plants evidence in the pooi to incriminate me .
hoping that id kiii you or youd kiii me .
and aii the while , garrett is trying to iock you up ... with the same psychos you put in the joint .
moss gets the iaw firm and the money to run it .
its a perfect plan .
briiliantly executed .
hes one smart son of a bitch .
if he was number two in his class ... it makes me wonder who was number one .
i was .
what ?
did you ieave the iight on ?
no .
lose the weapon , vargas !
dont do anything stupid .
sam ?
sam .
sam .
sam , what the heii are you doing ?
its funny .
what a man wiii do ...
the decisions he has to make .
just put the gun down .
weii talk through this .
just take it easy .
shut the fuck up !
becky was a bitch .
you could never see that .
what are you talking about ?
im tired , addison .
im tired of always being second chair .
tired of being number two to your number one .
sam , did you kiii my wife ?
see .
see .
you push and you push .
i wrote it aii down .
im glad you brought a witness .
sam , dont do this .
you know , add ...
aii we ever reaily had was each other .
please , sam .
no !
mr. terriil , did you read this ?
yeah .
he signed it and everything .
just about wraps it up .
case closed .
of course , he didnt go into much detaii about what happened .
he said he kiiled her .
thats enough .
i suppose .
i wish i had more to go on .
you know ... its a funny thing about getting to the end of something .
you have to wake up the next morning .
oh , addison .
addison .
im so , so sorry .
im just so , so sorry .
so am i.
good morning .
good morning .
where should i stick this wet towel ?
oh , just put it in the iaundry basket .
come on .
lets go outside and play .
i never cailed her .
i never cailed sarah .
aii right .
no .
sam !
yes ?
hey .
i dont think it was sam .
let it go , man .
yeah , but what if it was someone else ?
come on , addison .
let it go .
sam confessed .
just iisten to me for a second .
what if ...
what if it was a woman ?
strangling is not a womans crime .
to strangle someone takes strong hands .
very strong hands .
daddy , daddy , iook what i drew .
its a picture of the person who made mommy go away .
