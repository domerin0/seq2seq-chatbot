it is almost 100 years since christian armies from europe seized jerusalem .
europe suffers in the grip of repression and poverty .
peasant and lord alike flee to the holy land in search of fortune or salvation .
one knight returns home in search of his son .
france 1184
klngdom of heaven
crusaders .
clear the road if you will .
wait .
she was a suicide , cut off her head .
and return the axe .
you know this place my lord ?
know it ?
i knew all of it .
that is the man .
we need all these horses shod , we need food .
and we' il pay .
he says yes .
a blacksmith is the man you seek .
his name is ballian .
i know that he mourns .
the barrier we' ve passed through the crossroads was for his wife .
the child died .
she was overcome with grief and killed herself .
you still advise what you advised upon the road ?
i do , my lord .
what does that say ?
what man is a man who does not make the world better ?
leave me with this man .
i am sorry you lost your wife and child .
i also have lost ...
some say jerusalem is the very center of the world for asking forgiveness .
but myself i call it here .
now .
i knew your mother .
you could hear so i should say that it was against her objections .
but ...
i did not force that .
i loved her in my fashion .
balian , i' m your father .
and i have forgiveness to ask of you .
i am godfrey , the baron of ibelin .
i have 100 man in arms in jerusalem , if you will come with me you will have a living and will have my thanks , there it is .
you have your arm , my lord .
my place is here .
what made it your place is now dead .
you will never see me again .
if you want anything of me , take it now .
i want nothing .
i am sorry for your trouble .
god protect you .
jerusalem is easy to find .
come to where the men speak italian , and continue , till they speak something else .
we go by messina .
good bye .
they would have taken you to jerusalem .
away from all this .
i' m your priest , balian .
i tell you god has abandoned you .
i swear to you , you will have no peace as long as you stay here .
no man ever needed a new world more .
the village does not want you .
if you take the crusade , you may relieve your wife' s position in heaven .
i put to tell you , she was a suicide .
she is in hell .
though what she does there without a head ?
wait here .
if you' d come to kill me , even these days it is not easy .
well ?
i' ve done ...
murder .
haven' t we all ?
is it true , that in jerusalem i can erase my sins ?
and those of my wife .
is it true ?
we can find out together .
show me your hand .
pick it up .
let' s see what you' re made of .
his hand is hurt , my lord .
i once fought two days with an arrow through my testicle .
you have used the low guard .
you fight well .
let' s work on your skills .
pick a high guard .
like this .
italians call it la hoste de falcone .
the guard of the hook .
you strike from high .
this .
do it .
do it straighter .
come on .
take back .
hold your knees .
sword straighter .
defend yourself .
blade isn' t the only part of the sword .
attack .
may i have your lead ?
pay attention .
what' s this ?
you have with you man , balian .
who killed the priest .
i' m charged by the north bishop to bring him back .
what he says is true .
they have a right to take me .
i say it' s a matter of chats .
if you say he' s guilty , then we' il fight .
god will decide the truth of it .
my german friend is a close student of the law .
just give him to me , i' il fight you for something else .
he' s a murderer .
so am i.
whoever dies here today , you will certainly be among them .
you' re a lord .
let' s keep you the road .
to fight !
now you broke arrow .
if the ribs are broken , marrow may enter the blood .
in which case you' il take a fever and die .
or assist will form , and you' il live .
you' re in the hands of god .
give me some more wine .
it was not they had no right to take you ,
it was the way they asked .
they had the right to take me .
so do i.
plligrlm camp road to messlna
to kill an infidel is not murder , it is the path to heaven .
to kill an infidel is not murder , it is the path to heaven .
who is this ?
my son .
would i have fought you when you were still capable of making bastards .
i knew your mother when she was making hers .
fortunately you' re too old to be one of mine .
messlna port to the holy land
do you know what lies in holy land ?
a new world .
a man who entrants it , is in holy land the master of the city .
he who was the master of the city begs in the gutter .
there at the end of the world you are not what you are born , but what you have it in yourself to be .
i hope to find forgiveness .
that' s all i know .
whatever your position , you' re of my house .
and that means you will serve the king of jerusalem .
what could the king ask of a man like me ?
a better world than has ever been seen .
a kingdom of conscience .
a kingdom of heaven .
there' s peace between christian and muslim , we can live together .
living between saladin and the king we try .
did you think that play at the end of crusade ?
it does .
my son , you' re all that survives me .
do not disappoint me .
who are those men ?
muslim .
saracens .
and they' re allowed their prayers .
if they pay tax .
praise the god .
sounds like operas .
it' s good .
when the king is dead ,
jerusalem will be no place for friends of muslims .
or traitors to crusade , like your father .
i am guy de lusignan , remember that name .
and me .
leave it .
my lord .
how will you ride if you have no stick to beat the horse ?
he will be king of jerusalem one day .
balian !
come in .
i can' t go any further .
get on your knees .
be without fear in the face of your enemies .
be brave and upright that god may love thee .
speak the truth always , even if it leads to your death .
save god the helpless and do no wrong .
that is your oath .
and that' s so you remember it .
rise a knight and baron of ibelin .
defend the king .
if the king is no more , protect the people .
it' s time now my lord to confess to holy god , not your son .
are you sorry for all your sins ?
for all but one .
you sail now for jerusalem as your father wished .
i' il follow within a week .
this journey can be perilous .
if god has purpose for you there , he' il keep you safe in his hands .
if not ...
god bless you .
he says that is his horse .
why would it be his horse ?
because it' s on his land !
i took this horse from the sea !
he says you are a great liar !
and he will fight you , because you are a liar .
i have no desire to fight .
then you must give him the horse !
no .
fight me felly !
why ?
why should he ?
he is a knight .
and i am the baron of ibelin .
he says the baron of ibelin is old .
he knew him at damascus .
i am the new one .
that' s enough !
stop !
ibelin , that' s enough !
you' ve taken it very well that i' ve killed your master .
it was the end of his time .
old day has got recent .
now finish this .
take me to jerusalem .
very good horse .
take the horse .
and be about your business .
this is the price of battle .
i' m your prisoner .
your slave should you wish .
i' ve been a slave for very long time .
why would i want more suffering to begin .
the man you killed was a very great cavalier in muslims .
his name was mammolfice .
i will pray for him .
your quality will be known among your enemies before ever you meet them , my friend .
old man , where is it the christ was crucified ?
god , what is it you want from me ?
how can you be in hell , when you' re in my heart ?
you must have known him .
what ?
this you carry godfrey sword .
you must have known him .
i did .
a man my size .
yes .
green eyes .
blue .
come with us , my lord .
stop .
you hurt him .
where' s your master ?
i have none .
give me some water .
thank you for the drink .
if you happen to see balian , the son of godfrey .
tell him that sibyila come .
so , how fine is jerusalem ?
god does not speak to me .
not even on the hill .
where christ died .
i' m outside god' s grace .
i haven' t heard that .
anyway it seems i' ve lost my religion .
i' ve got no stock in religion .
by the word religion i' ve seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god .
holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves .
and goodness
what god desires is here and here .
and what you decide to do every day , you will be a good man .
or not .
come .
offlce of the marshall of jerusalem
the king has made a peace with saladin these past six years , he holds jerusalem as a place for prayer for all faiths .
as the muslims did before we came .
these men are templars , they killed arabs .
so they are dying for what the pope command them to do .
yes .
but not christ i think .
and not this king .
who says i raid ?
that witness .
all of jerusalem .
holy god .
and me .
that witness , if you call him that , is a saracen .
he lies !
it will come a day , reynald de chatillon , when you are not protected by your title !
when will that be ?
that will be a time when men are equal and kingdom of heaven has arrived ?
those templars have been hung for a raid that i know you commanded .
prove it .
i will wait in kerak until you do .
king will take your castle of kerak , reynald .
i' d like to wait when that is .
i' il be there .
my lord .
is it true .
you' re a father' s son .
he was mine friend .
i' m yours .
godfrey dead .
it could have come at a better time .
but it was shouted in the streets that you killed a great lord of syria .
saladin inserts a word that you' il fight to breach the peace .
that you had calls .
what know you of saladin ?
that he is king of the saracens , and that he surrounds this kingdom .
he has 200, 000 men in damascus alone .
he can win a war if he goes to war .
and he' s daily been caused for war by fanatics newly from europe .
by templar bastards like reynald de chatillon .
a year from this one i' il keep the peace , hardly coming up .
but with saladin and the king , between them .
would make a better world .
if it leds only for a while , tiberias , it still has left .
what did your father tell you of your obligations ?
that i was to be a good knight .
i pray the world and jerusalem to accommodate such a rarity as a good knight .
have you dined ?
the princess sibyila of jerusalem !
and her husband guy de lusignan .
so how many knights did you find in france ?
fifty .
it' s former legions to the king ?
of course , tiberias .
obviously .
you sit at my table !
is it not a king' s table ?
is it ?
i have not seen the king at it for some years .
i cannot eat , i' m finikin about the company .
in france this could not inherrit .
but here , there are no civilized rules .
i have business in east .
my wife does not lamented my absences .
that is either the best of wives , or the very very worst .
you' ve got to meet reynald ...
no my lord , he is in disfavour .
i am a member of this court .
why should i make lead with that troublemaker ?
to the very best of wives .
god bless jerusalem !
the king would see godfrey' s son .
i' il take him .
this morning i spoke without knowing who you were .
i knew who you were .
it' s unmistakable .
i loved your father .
and i sure love you .
do you fear being with me ?
no .
and yes .
a woman my place has two faces .
one for the world , and one which she wears in private .
with you i' il be only sibyila .
tiberias thinks me unpredictable .
i am unpredictable .
no , there .
come forward .
i' m glad to meet godfrey' s son .
he was one of my greatest teachers .
he was there when playing with the other boys , my arm was cut .
and it was he , not my father' s physicians who noticed that i felt no pain .
he wept when he gave my father the news .
that i am a leper .
the saracens say that this disease is god' s vengeance against the vanity of our kingdom .
as ratchet as i am these arabs believe that the time that waits me in hell is far more severe and lasting .
if that' s true , i call it unfare .
come , sit .
when i was 16 i won a great victory .
i felt in that moment i would live to be hundred .
now i know i shall not see thirty .
you see , none of us choose our end really .
the king may move men .
a father may claim a son .
but remember that even when those who move you be kings or men of power , your soul is in your keeping alone .
when you stand before god you cannot say but i was told by others to do thus .
or that virtue was not convenient at the time .
this will not suffice .
remember that .
i will .
then go now to your father' s house at ibelin and from there protect the piligrim road .
protect the helpless .
and then perhaps one day when i am helpless you will come and protect me .
there my lord .
ibelin .
your father was supported .
his lands were not .
it will suit me .
my lord .
you have a thousand acres , hundreds camels .
you have christians , jews , muslims .
you have 50 pairs of hogs .
what we do not have is water .
spread the walls .
i' m on my way to cana .
where jesus changed water to wine .
but a better trick would be to change you to a noble man .
that should be easy .
in france a few yards of silk can make a noble man .
i expect your hospitality .
it is given .
latif .
what ?
it seems years since i' ve seen a woman eat .
truly ?
i was watching you today .
you' ve been given a patch of land and it seems you will build a new jerusalem here .
this is my land .
who would i be if i did not try to make it better ?
they try to be one .
one heart .
one morality .
their profits are submit .
jesus says decide .
did you decide on guy ?
guy was chosen by my mother .
i was 15 at the time .
why do you think i' m here ?
i know that ibelin is not on the way to cana .
what else do you know , my lord ?
i know that you are a princess .
and i am no lord .
you' re knight .
neither and not proved .
i' m not here with you because i' m ...
i' m bored of wicked .
i' m here because ...
because mist between one person and another .
there is only light .
hold !
this caravan is armed , reynald .
good .
no smaller than ours .
they' ve seen us .
go after them .
riders getting away .
poor desert , nothing i' ve come of it .
i prefer not to be hanged before my wife is cooled .
don' t worry .
who but reynald , they' il say .
it' s always me .
they' re believing in jerusalem , i assure you .
you' re a nazareth pray .
you' re dangerous man , reynald .
if the war is to be now or later , better have it now .
how long can the leper last ?
guy de lusignan and reynald de chatillon with the templars have attacked the saracen caravan .
it was nought caravan .
but an army had it for better handle to desecrate the birth place of our lord !
reynald with the templars have broken the king' s bet of peace .
saladin will come into this kingdom !
tiberias knows more than the christian should about saladin' s intentions !
then i would rather live with man than kill him .
it' s certainly why you are alive .
that sort of christianity has its uses i suppose .
we must not go to war with saladin !
we don' t want it .
but you may not lead .
blasphemy !
an army of jesus christ which bears holy cross cannot be beaten !
has it come of tiberias suggest that it could be ?
there must be war !
god with it !
silence !
saladin has crossed the jordan with 200, 000 men .
he will make first for kerak and reynald de chatillon , my lord .
we must meet him before he reaches kerak .
i will lead the army .
my lord , if you travel ... you' il die .
send word to balian to protect the villagers .
assemble the army .
what becomes of us ?
the world will decide .
the world always decides .
my lord !
the king is riding to kerak .
kerak castle stronghold of reynald de chatlllon
saracen cavalry .
they' re coming to close rate on there .
these people are not safe outside the walls .
saladin will certainly come behind them .
go into the fortress now .
my lord balian !
my lord balian !
my lord reynald says you bring your force to kerak .
thank you but no .
if we do this people will die .
we' il hold the saracens cavalry until the king arrives .
so be it .
we cannot attack that and live .
what are you looking at ?
a knight .
his men .
are you with me ?
your quality will be known among your enemies before ever you meet them , my friend .
you were not that man servant .
no , he was my servant .
what becomes of us ?
as you deserve .
you reap what you sow .
you have heard of this , no ?
get up .
you may go into kerak .
but you will die there .
my master is here .
tell my lord saladin that jerusalem has come .
saladin .
i prey you pull back your cavalry and leave this matter to me .
i prey you retire on home to damascus .
reynald de chatillon will be punished .
i swear it .
withdraw or we will all die here .
do we have terms ?
we have terms .
i will send you my physicians .
reynald de chatillon !
