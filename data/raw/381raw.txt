luther , how we doin ' ?
not there yet , ethan .
i' il give you the word .
billy , ready to go ?
okay , package away in five
i' m not ready .
the louvers aren' t moving .
come on , luther !
we gotta go !
wait , there' s a glitch in the access code .
luther , we' re out of time .
on the count .
please , baby , open up , open up .
five , four , come on ! three , two , one !
i' m going now !
ethan , wait !
twenty five , twenty four , twenty three , twenty two , twenty one , twenty .
ethan , you' ve got 19 seconds to clear the cable .
okay , retracting cable !
come on !
nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two
cable' s clear !
transponder activated .
reading package and cable clear .
he' il breach the lab at the only possible time , whether you break in from the ground or the roof .
it' s 2300 hours , one minute ... when the air filtration generators will cover the sound of hunt' s break in ... and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable ... to our break in from below .
ethan , the generator' s about to go active .
just a friendly reminder .
we' il be out of contact for eight minutes .
i' m betting hunt will destroy chimera ... rather than attempt to preserve any part of it .
he' il have to do it in two places .
first , the incubation room where the growth vials are kept .
and finally , in the inoculation chamber ... holding the last remaining chimera virus in three injection guns .
he won' t be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns .
what' s this ?
you' re on time , for once ?
not exactly , sport .
john c. mccloy .
billy , i think we' ve got a problem .
nyah' s on the wing up early .
billy , do you copy ?
yeah , i got you , luther .
sorry , exactly where is she ?
in the building .
say again , mate .
sounds like you' re saying she' s in the building .
i am .
she is .
uh , well , then she' s not likely to be alone , is she , mate ?
she' s in the elevator , headed towards ethan .
how many of them ?
i can' t get through to ethan , not till the generators go .
yeah , well , when' s that ?
not for another ... five and a half minutes .
chimera in vitro ph and temperature level ... outside optimal range .
chimera in vitro ph and temperature level ... outside optimal range .
chimera working seed stock ph at critical level .
alert .
chimera stock life threatened .
alert .
chimera stock life terminated .
come on , ethan .
come on .
subject is contaminant free .
zero contaminant factor .
come on , come on , come on , come on .
luther , what the hell can we do ?
what can we do ?
hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
however we travel ,
i must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure .
how was i to know that he needed to be treated ... with bellerophon within 20 hours ?
get him .
how much longer before you can reach him ?
we' ve got 29 seconds before the generators turn off , then ethan will be back on line .
ahh !
luther !
luther !
hold your fire !
hold your fire , damn it !
well , hunt ... how' ve you been ?
fighting a bit of a cold .
aww .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes .
i would' ve thought the hardest part was curbing that pressing need of yours ... to get your gun off .
you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ... you never figured out where chimera really was .
i knew where it was .
oh .
then you knew the only way nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus ... is by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petridish .
you knew that ... while you were knocking him off , destroying the very thing you came for .
stop !
put a sock in it !
hit that bloody gun , and you' il spray the virus all over the place !
there it is , guys .
the last of it .
what was the top bid ?
why ?
you gonna make me a better offer ?
than $$37 million ?
not really .
oh !
somebody has been slipping you our mail .
come on out here , you bad girl .
sean , she doesn' t belong here .
let her go .
she wouldn' t be here ... if it wasn' t for you , hunt .
from this moment , you are responsible for what happens to her .
and if you' re looking out for her well being ,
i suggest you advise her to pick up the injection gun and bring it to me .
ball' s in your court , hunt .
nyah' s in the building .
do you copy ?
thank you .
how do you know he won' t shoot you the minute he' s got it ?
please .
one can' t hold nyah responsible for her actions .
you know women , mate .
like monkeys they are .
won' t let go of one branch till they get a grip on the next !
get it , nyah .
i' il cover you .
i am waiting .
things haven' t exactly worked out the way you thought they would , ethan .
sorry .
you bitch !
you' re not gonna shoot me , sean .
not this bitch .
' cause she' s worth $$37 million .
what did you think you were doing ?
i wasn' t thinking !
just trying to stop you from getting hurt , that' s all !
you who don' t have a conscience .
i guess i lied .
you can' t get us both out of here , can you ?
i' m infected with chimera .
you know you don' t have a choice .
just do it .
do it now !
we' ve got 19 hours and 58 minutes !
i' il get bellerophon into your system before then !
just stay alive !
i' m not going to lose you !
feel like pleading for your life ?
well , then , how about dying ... so you can make me a lot of money ?
in just a few hours time , you can be assured ... of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz .
g' day .
there' s not a chance of locating nyah until i can access the satellite .
and there' s not a chance of doing that until i can get this computer fixed .
how much time does she have left ?
not long .
but whatever happens , nyah will take care of nyah .
what do you mean ?
unless we dose her with bellerophon ,
nyah will kill herself .
so first things first .
ethan , ambrose and his team have arrived ... over the bridge , and nyah' s not with him , mate .
copy that .
you all right , mate ? looks like pretty heavy security from here .
what' s it look like from there ?
risky .
simon ?
simon !
stay here .
breached the structure at the 10 : 00 grating .
it' s a dna match .
the blood' s loaded with chimera .
and they certainly have bellerophon .
well , then you' ve got both the virus and the antivirus , which means i' ve got 30 million for you .
not exactly .
we don' t want just your cash .
what do you want ?
stock , mr. mccloy .
stock options , to be a little more precise .
cut her loose ... right in the center of town .
the more crowded the better .
ethan , just picked up an ambrose call .
nyah' s been dropped off .
where is she ?
somewhere in sydney .
somewhere in sydney ?
care to harden the target ?
i can' t until ...
i can get the gps up on our computer .
it' s down .
the clock is ticking .
how quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus ?
no time at all , once i' ve got it .
good .
biocyte stock is just a few weeks away from going through the roof .
what are you talking about ?
an outbreak of chimera .
where ?
downtown sydney , for a start .
you create the supply , mr. mccloy .
we' ve just created the demand .
three million people in sydney ... and 17 million people in australia ... are going to need bellerophon within the next few days , not to mention the rest of the world .
now , this is how it' s going to work .
wallis , the shares outstanding are ?
93 . 4 million .
which means , mr. mccloy , we need to get our hands on 480, 000 options .
we' il borrow your 30 million to buy those options .
your stock has never sold above $31 a share .
when your stock goes north of 200 , which it will , those options will be worth billions , and i will own 51 % of biocyte .
this is outrageous .
i will not let you take control of my company .
sit down .
you' il be a billionaire .
it' s better than being broke .
i have terrorists and ... other pharmaceutical companies standing in line .
the ball' s in your court , mr. mccloy .
run that bastard down .
we' re running short on time , mr. mccloy .
we have got to conclude our business .
yes .
start the transfer .
follow it ... and let me know .
uh !
raise your hands very slowly .
sure you want me to do this ?
raise your hands very slowly .
ethan , ethan , do you copy ?
do you copy ?
keep it going !
sean , this rat' s reached the end of the maze .
is he alive ?
yeah , more or less .
bring him to me .
go !
sean , transfer completed .
well done , stamp .
well done .
stop mumbling !
i' m afraid he' s got no choice .
i believe i broke his jaw .
stamp , i' m impressed .
right .
we don' t have a lot of time , hunt .
whatever you got to say , say it now .
how about giving us a big smile ?
no ?
what are you doing ?
get down on your knees .
now , this is what' s known ... as getting your gun off .
there he is !
ethan !
just back off and pin point your positions !
luther , clear the bridge for me !
hunt' s heading for the bridge , coming in at 12 : 00 high .
oh , i' m mad now .
ha ha !
you all right , mate ?
that punk put a hole in my versace !
ethan , the computer' s up .
i' ve got nyah .
she' s moved out of the city .
she' s on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs .
but i can' t get a visual .
copy !
she' s only got a little time left !
track ahead and pick her up !
i can' t get a good shot .
ethan , we won' t be able to cover you !
my earpiece is failing !
you' ve got me on gps !
bring her to me !
billy , north head bluff .
haul ass .
get out there and keep firing !
i can' t see anything !
slow down , mate !
slow down !
range is 2k .
ahhh !
go ahead .
use it , hunt .
it' s not a bad way to go .
it' s a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die .
hey , there she is !
hunt !
you should' ve killed me .
miss hall' s blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus , not even antibodies .
yes .
i gathered as much .
but you were under specific instructions , mr. hunt , to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus .
i' d be very interested to know how , after you managed this recovery , it subsequently got destroyed .
by fire .
it' s the best way , really .
oh .
well , mr. hunt , as for miss hall , in light of her efforts , her criminal record will certainly be expunged .
wiped out .
i' m assuming you approve .
i do .
yeah .
where is she now , by the way ?
any idea ?
i don' t know .
not exactly .
so , what are your plans ?
i don' t know .
uh , some sort of vacation .
i' il let you know where i' m going .
you don' t have to do that .
it wouldn' t be a vacation if you did .
let' s get lost .
