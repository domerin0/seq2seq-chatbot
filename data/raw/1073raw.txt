wkcc am talk radio .
all talk , all the time .
bringing you sports and weather on the five .
church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially motivated attacks ... ... on a militia like group calling themselves " the holnists .
one of the most radical and powerful of these groups ... ... claims as its founder , the famed motivational speaker nathan holn .
the last of the great cities died ... ... when my father was a child ... ... victims of yet another war .
he told of the plagues that followed ... ... and how the living hid themselves , scattered in tiny hamlets ... ... in hopes of surviving whatever new madness ... ... conspired to rob them of the little that remained .
in those days , he walked alone ... ... a solitary witness to the chaos that reigned .
the earth itself had fallen victim to the insanity .
he told stories of the 3 year winter ... ... and how the dirty snow never stopped falling .
he saw the ocean , barren , poisoned , near death .
and how they watched the sky for 16 long years ... ... praying for the great lungs to start working again .
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief .
many commuters are abandoning their vehicles .

and the day after that .

life' s but a walking shadow . . . . . . a poor player who struts . . . . . . and frets his hour upon a stage . . . . . . and is heard no more .
it' s a tale told by . . . .
idiot .
a moron . . . . . . full of sound and fury . . . . . . signifying . . .
. . . nothing .
but blow , wind !
come , wrack !
at least we' il die . . .
. . . with the harness off our back !

the children have never seen shakespeare before .
they still haven' t .
thank you .
you' re very kind .
i' m clapping because you stink .
larry !
i don' t think you know how it works .
when i was young , i tried to be an actor .
i was awful .
but now i won' t die thinking i was the worst one .
stop it !
that' s all right .
how much did you pay to get in ?
so bite me .
you were very good .
good enough to get something to eat ?
yes , we have some soup .
holnists .
goddamn !
bastards hardly kill anyone lately .
we give them food and supplies .
all the towns do .
i' d just as soon not give them anything of mine , thanks .

no running from the witches .
shakespeare , is it ?
i' m sorry i missed it .
we haven' t nearly stocked the game that we thought we would .

but you had time for a play ?
i' m taking 3 conscripts . . . . . . from each town !
they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army . . . . . . until such time as i see fit !
3 men .

captain !

ten hut !
i want a line right here .
welcome , gentlemen , to your new life .
you have been born again as soldiers in the united army of nathan holn .
god rest his soul !
the strong have been sapped . . . . . . by the whimpering propaganda of the weak .
men . . . . . . strong men , have been denied their destiny .
you men have been saved from that fate .
redemption . . . . . . is within your grasp .
you .
what did you do before you were given this opportunity ?
i had a shovel .
i digged holes .
you digged holes .
now you' il fill them .
and you ?
me ?
is there any question in anyone' s mind that i was speaking to you ?
yes , you .
i' m just a performer .
shakespeare .
stuff like that .
shakespeare ?
he was a writer .
yes , i know .
i know who shakespeare was .
cry ' havoc ! ' . . . . . . and let slip . . . . . . the dogs of war .
me ?
that is the question .
we few . . . . . . we happy few . . . . . . we band of brothers !
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer . . . . . . by this sun of york .
you' re pretty good .
you' re also a fighter .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
don' t you agree ?
no disrespect , sir , but you' d be better off letting me go .
a fighter is about the last thing that i am .
don' t you think i should be the judge of that , soldier ?
get up .
i said , get up !
you' re right .
you' re not a fighter .
but you will be .
i' m giving you a chance at a life . . . . . . that means something .
a life worth living .
i' m glad to see you .
we missed you .
i missed you .
kurt , how are you ?
hungry .
gretl , what happened to your finger ?
it got caught .
caught in what ?
friedrich ' s teeth .
thanks .
did i win ?
i tried to tell him .
say it again .
say what ?
words you said in town .
about the wind blowing and the rest .
say it again .
blow , wind .
come , wrack .
at least we' il die with the harness off our back .
what' s it mean ?
live free or . . . . . . die .
i think .
you' re going to watch a movie or you can sleep !
but tomorrow . . . . . . you run in uniform . . . . . . full packs . . . ... 20 miles !
everybody makes it ... ... or nobody eats ... ... for the third day in a row !
everybody up .
you got meat tonight .
why don' t you tell shakespeare what kind it is ?
mule .
god awful animal .
sterile offspring of horse and donkey .
can you imagine that ?
there' s no room in the new world for a bastard like that .
any man last in line ain' t hungry enough to eat .
you show up last . . . . . . you don' t eat !
i' m going to die before i' m last in line again !
that' s what they' re hoping for .
shut up !
at least you' re eating !
you serious ?
good .
this is good !
you want this ? !
this is what you want ?
babies !
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
these were supposed to be the best years of my life .
the laws of eight , gentlemen .
that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn .
may he burn in hell .
these are the laws that we live by .
the 8 . . . . . . is our symbol .
each man will bear it with pride .
only then will you be part of the clan .
sit down , gentlemen .
you will obey orders without question .
i told you to sit .
there weren' t enough chairs .
i didn' t specify chairs .
you could' ve sat on the ground .
you disobeyed a direct order .
you broke . . . . . . law one .
punishment shall be swift .
mercy . . . . . . is for the weak .
terror . . .
. . . will defeat reason .
your allegiance is to the clan .
justice can be dictated .
any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan .
does anyone wish to challenge me ?
on your feet .
there' s only one penalty .
death .
please !
i' m begging you !
you will get out of this army what you put into it .
work and you' il be fed .
fight and you' il be respected .
die and you' il be remembered .
you thinking of challenging for leadership ?
no , sir .
i' m a follower . . . . . . not a leader .
you got a smart mouth . . . . . . shakespeare .
you see colonel getty always following the general ?
he was the last man ever to challenge .
fight lasted 6 seconds . . .
. . . but he didn' t kill him .
cut off his tongue . . . . . . then he cut off his balls .
and old getty' s been following him around like a dog ever since .
fall out !
the general don' t see it . . . . . . but i say you' ve got some nigger in you .
they' re yours ?
a solitary man , aren' t you ?
binoculars to watch life from a distance and shakespeare . . . . . . to read about it , instead of living it .
no offense , but you seem to have read shakespeare . . . . . . yourself .
if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery . . . . . . a military commander must be classically educated . . . . . . philosophy and history , even a sense of the dramatic .
what do you think that i did before the war ?
do you think that i was in the army ?
i sold copying machines .
i was a salesman . . .
. . . with the talent to lead men , devise and execute a battle plan . . . . . . iocked away inside .
if nathan holn hadn' t come along , i' d still be selling copying machines .
can you imagine . . . . . . the wasted life ?
can you imagine the magnitude of that ?
but war . . . . . . war gives men like me a chance .
here .
the prize is often left unclaimed .
we must have the courage to grasp it . . . . . . for fortune always favors the bold .
he always inspires me .
i have a design for the future .
a master plan .
i will need able officers to help me carry it out .
you have the intelligence .
if your heart matches . . . . . . you will go far .
we' il talk more in weeks to come .
dismissed .
captain !
we' il be moving out tomorrow .
issue those binoculars to a scout .
and the book , sir ?
burn it .
quit moving !
what happened ?
what happened ?
what' d he say ?
nothing .
did he say anything about me ?
no !
i' m getting out of here .
what are you talking about ?
escaping .
what ? !
you ever hear of st. rose ?
it' s on the coast .
it' s a paradise .
we can' t .
we could !
between the 3 of us we could .
i can' t .
i like it here .
i like being a part of something .
take a point !
some of the men shot a lion .
they crawled into the thicket .
one of you dogs earned a treat .
over there .
those men hunted a lion this morning .
must' ve been a goddamn zoo here before the war .
anyway , a third man went in after it .
we don' t know if he' s alive or dead .
i want a volunteer .
one of you is going in there after him .
i' il go .
i guess size ain' t a measure of courage .
is it ?
i don' t think so , captain !
come out alive , you get a lion steak !
maybe you' il find your st. rose over there .
what the hell are you waiting for , christmas ?
why are you stopping ?
i found him .

let' s go .
hurry up !
you still got a lion to bag !

i don' t want to be a part of your army .
my army ?
i like the sound of that .
i got him !
i' m sorry .
how come . . . . . . you wrecked it . . . . . . for me ?
it' s me or you .
what ?
it doesn' t have to be .
we can go together .
you and me .
good boy !
good boy .

that' s it .

this is going in my report .
these people don' t need dreams , mr. postman .
they need something real .
they need help with the holnists .
are you going to bring them that ?
didn' t think so .
all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts .
i aim to keep it that way .

benning .
portland .

i guess .
everybody' s up late writing letters for you to take .
they' re so excited .
and how about you ?
do you have a letter ?
i don' t have anybody to write to .
i' il find you a pen pal .
someone with similar interests .
you know ?
like dancing and . . .
. . . checking for mumps .
you' re funny .
hardly anybody' s funny around here .
have you decided yet ?
been thinking about it .

i mean . . .

god , you' re so . . . .
you' re so . . . . . . beautiful .
i' m sorry , you probably want to keep things more clinical .
you don' t even know my name .
i don' t want to .
it would be easier for me . . . . . . if you closed your eyes .
we took a vote , mr. postman .
we want you to have this .
so you can' t say no .
i' il take it .
you got a bedroll , some oats and a week' s rations .
good .
thank you .
where will you go from here ?

times seem hard right now .
but you got to believe things are getting better .
birds are migrating again .
the rains are back .
stuff' s . . . .
stuff' s getting better .
o beautiful
for spacious skies
for amber waves of grain
shit !
you' ve got a hell of a nerve , whoever you are .
did you see abby around this morning ?
this is as far as i go .
you' re on your own .
god shed his grace on thee
and crown thy good
with brotherhood
are you really who you say you are ?
if i come back with some mail . . . . . . you' il know .
goddamn it !
what are you looking at ?
everything .
they don' t usually look at me .
who is responsible . . . . . . for that ?
i said . . . . . .
who' s responsible . . . . . . for that ? !
holnists , johnny .
you got to stay
you got to stay out of sight .
i' m a postman !
and i' m not running from anybody !
stay out of this , or i will lock you up myself .
you' il be responsible .
now set that flag on fire .
throw it through the window of your post office .
do it , michael .
it' s all right , michael .
throw it .
the united states . . . . . . doesn' t exist !
that flag is an abomination !
there was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it . . . .
i looked at it and it had a color to it .
good .
everything .
i was amazed .
it was . . . .
good lord !
that , gentlemen . . .
. . . is a first rate piece of ass .
tell the sheriff to introduce me .
she doesn' t belong in this mudhole .
excuse me .
you again !
that' s my wife , general .
she' s a married woman .
really ?
do you know what system of government we have here ?
we have what is known as a feudal system , like in the middle ages .
that' s lords and vassals .
that' s you and me .
now those lords . . . . . . they had some ideas .
they believed that if a vassal got married . . . . . . it was the lord' s right . . . . . . his right . . . . . . to sleep with the bride on the wedding night .
me and abby have been married 3 years .
i' m sorry , but i wasn' t invited to the wedding .
you' ve already done me one favor , son .
don' t let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record .
we' il be civilized about this .
i want you to give me your blessing .
sir , i can' t .
you can' t ?
you can' t .
can' t .
we had a great nation once .
know what made it great ?
i can .
till the weak came along .
the " i can' ts " destroyed us !
i' m going to make us strong again .
i' m going to be the father . . . . . . of a new nation .
and do you know why . . . . . . it will be me ?
because i can .
stop it !
you' re killing him !
let me go !
please , let me go !
help him , somebody !
please !
you didn' t have to !
didn' t have to what ?
you bastard !
you killed him !
your people seem seditious .
you seem seditious .
what am i seeing here ?
i' m waiting !
a man came through with mail .
said he was a postman .
said that the government had been restored back east .
what government ?
the united states government !
who said that ?
which way did he go ?
do not make me ask again .
east .
send a patrol east !
send 3 more . . . . . . north , south and west !
they' d better find him east .
take that damn shirt off , johnny !
i managed to save these .
do you want to die too ?
i' m headed south with the mail .
don' t be a fool .
what should i be ?
rachel clark .
charlie sykes .
graham drewitt .
g. d. died of flu last winter .
that' s all there is .
that' s all there is , folks .
for now .
but there' il be more , lots more , once there' s a real system in place .
right ?
what about new york city ?
did they survive the plague ?
survive ?
they got broadway up and running again .
there' s a kid doing andrew floyd webber , you wouldn' t believe .
how much is it to mail a letter ?
mail . . . .
they won' t open the gates .
they say they got a representative of the restored united states in there .
they say this army is illegal .
and they say  drop dead !
and go to hell !
that' s what they say .
what are you doing ? !
open the gates .
idiots !
what' re you thinking ? !
the romans . . . . . . had an expression . . . . . . they used to scare their children .
hannibal ... ... ad portas !
hannibal . . . . . . is at the gates .
do you know who hannibal was ?
of course not .
a pretty girl like you wouldn' t understand something like that .
let' s fight them !
with what ?
we' ve got 5 guns , maybe 20 rounds of ammo .
how we going to fight with that ?
you don' t .
negotiate a settlement .
give them extra supplies .
you' re the government rep .
tell them .
right here .
make it quick .
i' ve got an attack to coordinate .
they' ve asked me to negotiate a peace treaty .
do i know you ?
i don' t think so , sir .
you' re the postman .
aren' t you ?
inside !
u. s. mail .
the restored united states of america .
do these people really believe that shit ? !
who are you , really ?
i' m a united states postman . . . . . . authorized by order 41 7 of the restored congress .
i was at the battle of georgetown .
i watched the white house burn down .
do not try to sell me . . . . . . on any restored united states !
the new capital is based in minneapolis . . . . . . inside the hubert humphrey metrodome .
you know where the vikings used to play ?
you' re funny .
what are the terms ?
they' il open the gates , give double the usual . . . . . . just . . . . . . don' t hurt anybody .
this was all a misunderstanding .
i appreciate your offer , mr. postman .
but the fact is that you' re in no position to negotiate .
these people made it through the bugs and the riots . . . . . . and the 3 year winters , but they' re not going to survive you .
fire at will !
justice can be . . . . . . dictated !
kill him , and kill the restored united states with him .
in accordance with law 8 . . . . . . and by the authority of emergency order 46 . . . . . . you are hereby
get her !
go on , get him !
we can' t stop now .
what are you . . . ?
oh , god !
come on down .
don' t move .
if you had a bullet , you' d use it .
come on .
i don' t think i ever had water soup before .
maybe next time we could try it with a little sand .
dirt .
maybe a twig garnish .
you used to think i was funny .
they killed michael .
i' m sorry .
how sorry are you ?
what ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
what' s with you ?
you have the mark of 8 on you .
mark doesn' t mean
you' re a liar .
you were with bethlehem .
does that make you one of them ?
don' t make me use this .
wind' s come up .
it' s getting colder too .
must be another storm .
anything else ?
i didn' t mean for you to . . . .
your legs are going to rot off if you don' t try to walk .
i' m hurt .
you' re lazy !
lazy ?
i got a hole in my stomach . . . . . . and i' m weak .
the 2 big meals around here are snow and grass . . . . . . and we' re running out of grass .
what' re you doing ?
give me a break !
i' m going to check the pass .
why are you in such a hurry ?
i could think of worse places .
or i could think of worse company .
perfect !
help !
help !
please !
quick !
god , help me !
i told you that' s all there was .
that' s why you should have it .
i knew you could walk .
you' re weird .
know that ?
we walked on the moon once , abby .
so ?
what good is that now ?
obviously you' ve forgotten . . . . . . tang and . . . . . . microwave ovens and . . . .
your face looks pretty .
i mean . . . . . . not so bruised .
look . . . . . . there' s something you' d better know .
you' re going to find out soon enough .
i' m pregnant .
it' s michael' s baby .
you' re just the body father .
how do you know it' s mine . . .
. . . not bethlehem' s ?
he tried with me almost every night .
he couldn' t do it . . .
. . . so he beat me .
said it was my fault .
i' m sorry , abby .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
is it the baby ?
the pass is clear .
what happened ?
good , you got our stuff out .
of course .
what ?
i don' t understand .
i set the fire .
did you think we' d stay here forever ?
no .
i' d appreciate it if you' d walk with me to find someplace safe for the baby . . . . . . then we can split up .
you shaved .
looks nice .
you' re really weird !
you know that ?
you ever heard of st. rose , abby ?
i' ve heard people talk .
i' ve heard lots of names . . . . . . bliss , hesperia , and new eden .
sheriff briscoe says it' s a fantasy .
he' s wrong .
st. rose is out there . . . . . . and i' m going to find it .
but you' re the postman .
i' m nobody , abby .
this is what i hate .
strangers .
do you say hi , or do you blow their heads off ?
do they want to share what they got or take what you have ?
if they want to take , how far are you willing to go to stop them ?
all right , that' s far enough .
we don' t want any trouble .
me neither , mister .
what are you ?
carrier 1 8 . . . . . . u. s. postal service .
got any mail ?
that' s impossible .
ain' t you heard of the postman ?
no .
tell us .
he' s only the greatest man who ever lived .
he crossed the wasteland . . . . . . shook his fist at the enemy . . . . . . and spit in the eye of general bethlehem himself .
he' s back east with president starkey right now .
who told you all this ?
postmaster ford lincoln mercury .
he' s in direct contact with the restored congress .
direct contact ? !
i don' t believe this !
carrier camp !
carrier camp !
gather around , everybody !
come on , gather around .
got another letter here .
it came in last night .
what' s all this ?
the postman sent ford another letter .
he' s going to read it .
hello , all postal carriers .
i' m here in minneapolis with president starkey . . . . . . but my thoughts are with you .
remember . . . . . . nothing worth doing can be done overnight .
keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot .
signed . . . . . . the postman " !
his letters are always kind of short .
hold on !
there' s a p. s.
does anybody know what p. s. stands for ?
holy shit !
that would be h. s. , eddie .
no , i saw him once when i lived in pineview .
it' s the postman .
guess you want to talk about this .
i found him !
minneapolis " ?
p. s. ford knows what to do " ?
what is this ?
what is all this ?
what the hell
i lied !
i told people you were in direct contact with me .
why ?
because i didn' t want it to end .
look . . . . . . i don' t know how long i can stay .
i mean . . . . . . president starkey . . . . . . he' s going to send word for me one day and then i' il have to move on .
do you understand ?
but you' il stay until he sends word , right ?
don' t do that .
hands down .
you' re staying till president starkey sends word , right ?
yes !
until he sends word .
right .
could you say a few words just so they know it' s really you ?
it' s me .
coming down .
we bring all the mail here first .
we sort it .
we group it .
then it goes out .
so far , we got 30 routes .
you spelled " tyranny " wrong .
boy !
he' s smart .
from the swift completion . . .
. . . of their appointed rounds .
congratulations .
you are now u. s. postal carriers .
how old are you ?
i' m 68 , sir .
can i ask you a question ?
can you ride ?
no .
can' t walk too good either .
so why are you here ?
i know stuff .
where did you get that ?
1 970 .
a girl with eyes as big as saucers . . . . . . did me in a little town called saigon .
ford wants me to have his place .
said it' s the best .
i' m on the other side .
i got plenty of room here .
so much for the uniform theory .
he was captured on the oregon border .
who the hell are you ?
carrier 1 2 .
united states postal service .
i want the camp struck at dawn .
we' il be moving north !
you spelled " tyranny " wrong .
i wish they' d stop saluting .
just stay safe .
remember . . . . . . the mailman' s more important than the mail .
boy , he' s smart .
when i was a kid we used to turn our hat around backwards .
thought it was cool .
jesus christ !
damn !
i missed him .
what' s the name of this town ?
we never named it .
i officially declare . . . . . . postal station number 1 0 . . .
. . . in elvis , oregon . . . . . . open for business .
from now on you got to get your mail down there , okay ?
this one doesn' t work .
read it again .
are you sure ?
yes .
what a miracle to hear from you .
stuff is getting better .
stuff is getting better every day .
i don' t know who you are . . .
. . . but i do know i was wrong about you .
got a letter for you too , sheriff .
it' s from my sister .
thought she was dead .
you thought wrong .
would you like to dance ?
well , they say that you can never
never go back home
and if you' re bound to wander
you' re bound to be alone
you say i got no right
to feel what i feel
when i look into your eyes
want to dance ?
but that i dream of you
most every night
comes as no surprise
well , i' ve been out on this road for so long
far and wide
do i roam
but something in your smile tells me
i' m almost home
i was lost in the dark
all alone
till the light
in your eyes showed me
i was almost
home is where the heart is
and my heart goes with you
i would travel till the end of time
if that' s what i have to do
just to spend one night
till your sweet love light
come down
shining down on me
hello .
who do you talk to ?
not a soul in 7 years of trying . . . . . . but i will .
want some ?
no , thanks .
don' t let the kids see that .
you go ahead , take a look .
i was an aerospace engineer .
i helped design the galileo space station .
no shit ?
no shit .
i dream it' s orbiting the earth forever . . . . . . with a dozen human skeletons . . . . . . all grinning at each other . . . . . . iaughing at us down here .
what is it ?
it' s tony .
he' s overdue .
that makes 5 .
all on southern routes .
just children .
you bring me children .
i want a man .
we got births and . . . . . . deaths .
got weather .
mostly gossip .
there' s nothing here .
nothing ?
everything . . . . . . is here .
am i the only one who sees that ? !
what ?
a military man , especially a commander . . . . . . should keep a journal .
after he' s gone , it' s the only real defense . . . . . . against the slander that later arises .
tell me about the other stuff you know .
shit !
get rid of the bodies .
i don' t want these people blamed for what we did .
neither snow , nor rain , nor gloom of night ... ... through bandit' s hell , through firefight ... ... through flood and plague we cannot fail ... ... no holnist trash will stop the mail .
you are now u. s. postal carriers .
they changed the oath .
ford' s idea .
figures .
they don' t think to ask who they' re replacing . . . . . . or why .
sir ?
it' d be an honor if i could shake your hand .
do i know you ?
i don' t think so .
good luck , then .
nice kid .
he' il probably be dead in a week .
now that is not your fault .
you' re exhausted .
you need rest .
there' s food
where are you going ?
route 22 .
you' re grounded .
get off the horse .
you know the rule .
what rule ?
22 , it' s too far south .
get off the horse .
but they' re waiting on
get off the goddamn horse !
i' il tie him off to this one .
you can' t keep doing this !
doing what ?
riding all the routes .
you' re not saving anybody .
did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman ?
i don' t know if you' d laugh or cry .
what is it ?
watch out !
we got fire !

" postage due . " elvis patrol .
you want a war ?
you want a war ? !
i' il give you . . . . . . a war !
i was . . . . . . born for it !
you murderers !
you think you can ride ? !
then today' s your lucky day !
bethlehem says ... ... he' s headed north .
he' s going to kill 10 people in every town ... ... then burn it to the ground for what you did .
he said that pineview' s on his way .
he' d wait there for you , but not for long .
i was so scared , sir .
i thought they were going to kill me too .
see ?
we' re too late .
i told you .
what' re you going to do ?
i' m going to stop this .
you can' t .
get out of the way , ford .
all of you !
they' il kill you !
hold him !
stop it !
you' re hurting him !
i' m not !
yes , you are !
i' m not !
i' m not hurting him .
this is all my doing .
i went against your orders .
you told me to bury the dead holnists , but i sent them bethlehem .
why ?
bethlehem has to know we won' t stop !
goddamn it , ford !
those people are dying because of us !
they' re dying because of what we did .
they' re not !
they' re dying because of bethlehem . . . . . . because this is a shitty world !
lf we' re going to change it . . . . . . then someone might have to die .
if i could make it be me down there , i would , but i can' t !
no !
please !
you , out here !
hold her !
please !
he' s out there somewhere .
watching .
i can feel it .
you feel it too , don' t you ?
it didn' t have to end like this , sheriff !
he knew where i' d be if he wanted to face me like a man !
instead he' s hiding . . . . . . iike a rabbit !
so much for your postman !
lieutenant !
ready !
we don' t even know their names .
we know their names .
i think that' s my dad .
aim !
ride , postman !
ride !
you hear me ? !
i said , " ride !
fire !
my god , what have i done ?
what ford did was wrong !
but it doesn' t change anything . . . . . . for any of us , does it ?
is this everybody ?
the rest are on the overdue list .
then this is everybody .
got a letter from the president .
greetings , all carriers .
greetings , president starkey !
i' ve been in contact with the postman .
and i' ve received all the reports .
i' m proud of you all .
in dark days , in a weary world . . . . . . you gave everything and asked for nothing .
you beat back despair and replaced it with hope .
for that , your country can never repay you .
but the price is too high . . .
. . . and i won' t see any more of my bravest die .
it is my duty to hereby disband . . . . . . the postal service of the restored united states .
you are to burn your uniforms . . . . . . and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once .
thank you .
and god bless you all .
the president .
the president never wrote that letter .
if he could' ve , that' s what he would have said .
who' s the other letter to ?
bethlehem .
i' m taking it to him in the morning .
what' s it say ?
mail' s private , you know that .
what does it say ?
it says it' s over .
it says we quit .
it says you quit !
what about the oath ?
tell me something , ford .
how much mail can a dead postman deliver ?
it' s over .
then i' il take it .
i can' t trust you .
if this is the end . . .
. . . if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered . . .
. . . i' il take it .
whoever delivers this letter , ford , probably dies for it .
i' m still a postman !
you owe it to me .
i owe it to me .
it' s not ford' s fault .
he' s not like you .
he doesn ' t have your memories .
none of them do .
this is all they have .
it' s the only decent thing they know .
what ?
being a postman ?
it' s all bullshit , abby .
all of it .
i took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm .
i made up the rest to stay fed .
there is no . . . . . . restored united states .
i figured it was something like that .
i' m going to st. rose .
i' m taking you with me .
i' ve already packed your horse .
i know you don' t want to hear it . . . . . . but that' s my child inside you .
i want to see it born somewhere safe .
i thought i recognized you .
general bethlehem said you should be on your knees when i do this .
i don' t give a damn what that asshole said .
the general is a great man !
the general is a fucking lunatic .
you want to see a man ?
that' s a man .
you ready ?
yes .
you' re a better man than bethlehem .
i' ve seen it .
to bethlehem .
this letter is my testimony ... ... to the fact that there is no ... . . . and there is no postal service .
he expects me to believe this ?
it' s true .
i was there .
he disbanded the carriers . . .
. . . and rode west .
traitor !
then i' ve won .
bring the one we found yesterday .
they can die together .
you traitor !
you' re a traitor !
that one' s the second in command .
why doesn' t that surprise me ?
i was thinking , sir . . .
. . . he might be more valuable to us as a prisoner .
you were supposed to kill him . . . . . . weren' t you ?
i couldn' t get close enough .
who are you ?
my name' s clark .
postal carrier for the restored republic of california .
who are you ?
postmaster ford lincoln mercury .
it' s an honor .
wait !
wait a minute .
hold your fire .
you two don' t know each other ?
this' il never be over .
it' il go on .
except i' il be fighting a goddamn ghost .
should we fire , sir ?
no , goddamn it !
i won' t fight a ghost .
tabula ... ... rasa ... . . . gentlemen .
a clean slate .
i want all mail carriers hunted down .
i want the postman found .
i want him dealt with .
colonel , organize the scouts .
you said he rode west ?
and this is his second in command ?
yes , sir !
i' il keep you to bargain with .
the postman is weak that way .
set your rifle on the ground !
set it on the ground .
what ?
this old thing ?
it isn' t even loaded .
where are we ?
you' re in bridge city . . .
. . . where we don' t allow guns .
the sentry said you were coming .
i know you .
you' re . . . . . . famous .
i was once . . . . . . sort of . . . . . . kind of .
not anymore .
looking to cross ?
we will be .
right now we' d appreciate some food .
okay .
there are some kids behind us .
how many ?
3 .
3 .
okay .
come on in , guys !
i know you' re out there .
wait .
just wait .
what did he want ?
hold on .
he says . . . . . . he' s looking for the postman .
there' s no such thing anymore .
the man on the horse says there is .
he thinks he' s here .
and he' s coming back with friends .
what' s a postman ?
you never heard of a postman ?
are you the postman ?
yeah .
i heard of you , man .
you' re famous .
yeah , i guess i am .
and all of a sudden , i' m not . . . . . . wearing the right clothes .
man , you' re going to love this !
open that second chute , bro !
you have a gift , postman .
i saw it back in pineview .
you' ve given us all back what we' d forgotten .
you made mrs. march feel like she could see again .
you made ford feel like he was part of the world .
you give out hope like it was . . . . . . candy in your pocket .
remember this ?
i remember .
i always like to think that you left it on purpose .
this is hard for me .
michael was the best man i ever knew .
i never thought there' d be another man i could love the way i loved him .
i couldn' t see it for so long .
and now you' re leaving .
and i' m afraid .
i' m afraid you' il never find your st. rose .
it' s not important .
i' m afraid you' il never see your baby .
i need full power , man !
this dude' s got a long way to go !
this thing' s working perfect , man !
a lot higher than it looks , huh ?
you nearly went .
get in .
there' s 3 good sized towns up ahead . . . . . . with enough people to help you if you can convince them to come .
don' t tell anybody . . . . . . i like to ride this damn thing just for the hell of it .
being a city official has its perks , you know ?
trust me , man .
this' il get you there a lot faster .
how do i stop ?
quit worrying about the little things .
good luck , and godspeed .
reporting for duty , sir !
know what to do ?
talk to the people .
tell them it' s important .
tell them we can make a difference .
once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more ... ... or close the wall with our dead !
in peace , nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility .
but when the blast of war blows in our ears ... ... then imitate the action of the tiger .
summon up the blood .
disguise fair nature with rage ... ... and lend the eye a terrible aspect .
who are they ?
i don' t know .
looks like mostly women and young people to me .
how many ?
it' s an army .
at last . . . . . . someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me .
reckoning , gentlemen !
they' re an eager looking bunch !
morale is a dangerous thing .
bring up the prisoner !
we' il show them how this game is played .
stay here .
is he surrendering ?
god , i hope not .
my little shipping clerk .
mr. copy machine salesman .
we' re both a couple of frauds .
so be it .
but great men are made by other great men .
patton had rommel .
grant had lee .
but i get you .
you' re no general .
you' re not even a good painter .
trying to goad me into a fight ?
it' d be great if wars were fought just by the assholes who started them .
we could settle this right here . . .
. . . you and me .
unfortunately , it doesn' t work that way .
but it does in your army .
i invoke law seven . . . . . . of the laws of eight !
any man may challenge for leadership of the clan " !
i challenge you .
you' re not a holnist .
you' re not a member .
you don' t have the right .
i have every right !
i invoke law seven .
where . . . ?
i challenge . . . . . . for leadership of the clan !
where do i know you from ?
cry havoc . . . . . . and let slip the dogs of war
you remember that ?
shakespeare .
the one who didn' t want to fight .
i should have found a way to kill you then , but you seemed so strong .
law seven . . .
. . . it is !
this war is settled here !
i studied people .
i know your problem .
do you know . . . . . . why you can' t fight ?
because you have nothing to fight for .
you don' t care about anything .
you don' t value anything .
you don' t believe in anything !
and that' s what makes me better .
i believe . . . . . . in the united states .
it doesn' t have to be this way .
we don' t have to kill each other .
mercy . . . . . . is for the weak .
ford , don' t !
there' s only one penalty . . . . . . and that penalty is death .
he isn' t worth it .
i' m the head of the clan now !
there are going to be new laws !
no more killing .
there' s going to be peace !
how about it , ford lincoln mercury ?
be a leader , ford .
live . . . . . . and let live .
your daddy wrote to tell you . . . . . . he' il be here as soon as he can . . . . . . and that he loves you very much .
mail' s slow .
i' m going to have to see about that .
your daughter .
her name is hope .
my father saw how fragile we are ... . . . and how quickly we fell into the hands of tyranny .
he saw that ordinary men . . . . . . could reach deep within themselves and find courage .
he saw that if we began to communicate as a nation . . . . . . we could become strong again . . . . . . united .
but he never did see st. rose .
he said . . . . . . there was too much to be done .
he' d made a promise .
and in keeping it , he traded one dream for another .
with no regrets .
and so , in honor of my father . . . .
that was me .
subtitled by gelula & co . , inc .
the united states doesn' t exist !
i' m giving you a chance at a life that means something .
redemption is within your grasp .
you are required to show yourself .
but i' m not with these people .
i' m just passing through .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
kill him !
you just head back the way you came .
we don' t give charity .
i' m a representative of the united states government authorized . . . . . . by the restored congress to reestablish communication route .
what' s that mean in english ?
it means i' m your postman .
you are nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail .
i have a feeling about you .
i know you' il do what' s right .
who' s responsible . . . . . . for that ?
a man came through with mail .
said he was a postman .
said that the government had been restored back east .
what government ?
the united states government !
how about you ?
do you have a letter ?
i don' t have anybody to write to .
i took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm .
there is no restored united states .
you gave them back their memories .
you' ve given us what we' ve forgotten .
you have a gift , postman .
you give out hope like it' s . . . . . . candy in your pocket .
i want all mail carriers hunted down .
you' ve got to stay out of sight !
i' m a postman !
i want the postman found .
i want him dealt with .
how much mail can a dead postman deliver ?
we' re not going to stop !
somebody might have to die !
you can' t keep doing this .
you' re not saving anybody .
did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman ?
i don' t know if you' d laugh or cry .
do you hear me , postman ? !
i said , " ride !
you want a war ? !
i' il give you . . . . . . a war !
there used to be a postman . . . . . . for every street in america .
they wore uniforms and hats . . . . . . just like this one .
getting a letter . . . . . . made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself .
i don' t think we ever really understood . . .
. . . what they meant to us until they were gone .
