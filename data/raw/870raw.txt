# through early morning fog i see
# visions of the things to be
# the pains that are withheld for me
# i realise and i can see
# that suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the game of life is hard to play
# i' m gonna lose it anyway
# the losing card i' il someday lay
# so this is all i have to say
# suicide is painless
# suicide
# it brings on many changes
# changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the sword of time will pierce our skins
# it doesn' t hurt when it begins
# but as it works its way on in
# the pain grows stronger , watch it grin
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# a brave man once requested me
# to answer questions that are key
# is it to be or not to be ?
# and i replied " oh , why ask me ?
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# and you can do the same thing
# if you please

you keep it up , you hear ?
our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .

amen .

# onward , christian soldiers
# marching as to war
# with the cross of jesus

she won' t keep us awake all night praying .
i' ve been here a long time .
i know what you' re trying to pull , but you won' t push me around .
not for the world would i push you around , but , look , there is one more thing .
we need a chest cutter .
we need a good one , or there' il be trouble .
no mash unit has a chest surgeon .
we won' t get one .
sir , they' re behind in the or and the pre op ward is jammed up .
the helicopters and ambulances are coming in full .
you have to work early today .
and add overtime to a 12 hour day ?
the union' il raise cain with you .
with those hours , you need rest .
you can' t get it with burns jabbering to god .
burns will go in 24 hours .
tell them captain pierce and captain forrest are on the way .
henry , there' s one more thing .
i told you major burns will go in 24 hours .
the chest cutter .
no .
i' il try .
you can' t ask more than that .
my operation was fine .
it' s the head wound that did him in .
dish , get over here and hold this retractor .
dish , let me have a long needle holder .
dago !
amen .
pull it back , duke .
hell , i can' t .
get hold of the other one .
dago , i want you to hold this retractor .
now .
please , come on .
now .
yes .
i' m sorry .
hi , dago .
hold on .
don' t wiggle it .
just hold on .
clamp .
sorry , dago , but this man' s still alive and that other man is dead , and that' s a fact .
can you hold it with two fingers , dago ?
hell , did you see it ?
where' s hawkeye ?
you mean captain pierce ?
no , i' d have to look at the duty roster .
they' re in there .
oh , man .
hawkeye , you gotta remember , i' m married .
i' m married .
i love my wife .
if she was here , i would be with her .
there is no question of loving anybody .
it is a question only of helping ...
you see , i made a vow to myself ... ... that while i was gone i was gonna be faithful to my husband .
those are vows you make when you' re with somebody .
hawkeye ?
ho jon ?
duke say you better haul ass home quick .

back home .
some reason i shouldn' t know which hospital ?
i don' t know .
i will ask .
is there some reason my friend should not know the name of the hospital ?
there doesn' t appear to be any reason .
i' ve seen you somewhere before .
i don' t know your name , stranger , but your face is familiar .

are you a beer drinker , or would you like to share a martini ?
martini .

i' d love a martini .
ho jon , give the gentleman a martini .
i think you will find these accommodating .
they' re quite dry .
don' t you use olives ?
olives ?
where the hell d' you think you are ?
we do have to make concessions to the war .
we' re three miles from the front line .
yes , but a man can' t really savour his martini without an olive , you know .
otherwise , you see , itjust ... ... doesn' t quite make it .
attention .

that' s a captain ?

who started this ?
i hit him !
he' s an ignoramus , that knucklehead !
he wouldn' t have touched me if i' d had my guard up .
let us settle this , colonel , between ourselves .
alone !
think this is an english boarding school ?
mclntyre , you' re under arrest .
confine yourself to quarters .
henry , are you kidding ?
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident .
we try to remember we' re a military organisation .
i should certainly hope so .
vollmer , that man is under arrest .
confine him to his quarters .
captain mclntyre , you are officially ...
come on .
cut it out , vollmer .

sorry , colonel .
what the hell' s the matter with you ?

please .
ho jon , some coffee .
what' s wrong with you ?
i don' t know .
i must have lost my punch .
i never expected the son of a bitch to get up !
that' s no kind of an answer .
you know why he did it .
i can' t have my junior officers striking each other .
dammit , henry .
frank burns is a menace !
every time a patient croaks on him he says it' s god' s will or somebody else' s fault .
this time he blamed it on some kid who was stupid enough to believe him .
i' m tired of you trying to run this outfit .
there' s going to be disciplinary action .
what are you gonna do , henry ?
i' d planned to name trapper chief surgeon ... ... to consult on your shift and frank' s .
that' s damn good thinking .
but now i can' t do it for at least a week .
if i announced it now after what our new chief nurse saw , she' d yell to washington .
don' t you have any sugar in this place ?
good morning .
today' s musical selections will be rendered by ... ...
achi takamura seamuchiwa bobcats .
colonel blake , general hammond did not answer the phone .
he was at a football game .
those generals have all the fun !

may i have the camp' s attention ?
this week' s movie will be " when willie comes marching home " .
uh , the biggest parade of laughs of world war il .
all the loves , laughs and escapades of the willies who came marching home .
this film stars dan dailey , corinne calvet and colleen townsend .
captain pierce , may i join you ?
you' ve already joined me , gorgeous .
you' re a sight for sore eyes .
where do you come from ?
well , i like to think of the army as my home .
oh , yeah ?
yeah ?
ho jon , bring me some ketchup .
i' ve been observing the nurses on your shift .
i know .
naturally , your own opinion is more informed than mine .
you want to know what i think of the nurses on my team .
i' il tell you .
i think they' re fine , just great .
i' m totally satisfied with them .
oh , no , that' s the second time this week .
of course , what do you expect ?
welcome , gentlemen .
# when the lights go on again
# all over the world
you got enough room ?
is he all right , hawkeye ?
is he all right , dago ?
yes , you mean is he gonna live ?
he' il live .
i hope somebody' s gonna be around tomorrow morning when he wakes up ... ... to tell him that he hasn' t got anything between his legs any more .
syngman rhee paid the light bill .
major burns is far from satisfied .
that doesn' t surprise me .
frank burns does not know his way around an operating theatre .
he does not know his way around a body .
and if you' il have observed anything , you' il have observed that frank burns is an idiot .
he has flipped his wig , he is out of his head , he' s a lousy surgeon .
on the contrary , i have observed that major burns is not only a good technical surgeon , ... ... he is a good military surgeon .
you finished ?
i have also noticed that nurses as well as enlisted men address you as " hawkeye " .
because that' s my name .
hawkeye .
that kind of informality is inconsistent with maximum efficiency .
oh , come off it , major !
you' ve put me off my fried lobster .
do you realise that ?
i' m gonna go back to my bed , i' m gonna put away the best part of a bottle of scotch ... ... and under normal circumstances , you being normally what i' d call attractive , ... ... i would have invited you back to share my little bed with me and you might have come .
but you really put me off .
i mean , you' re what we call a regular army clown .
i wonder how such a degenerate ... ... could have reached a position of responsibility in the army .
he was drafted .
radar !

you' re going to see hammond .
i' m spending the day with hammond .
major burns is in charge .

but who' s gonna be on cq tonight ?
wait a minute .
what about the ... ?
oh , captain .
yes , sir .
i have some shirts with the buttons missing .

i' d be glad to do them .
you don' t have to .
it' s nothing .
nice jacket .

oh , yeah .

it was sent to me .
you don' t have to do that .
take care .

this letter has been written in the interest of army morale .
we feel it is our duty to bring this unwholesome situation to your attention .
we write this jointly to assure you no one' s personal feeling has influenced this report .
respectfully , margaret j houlihan , major burns .
that' s perfect .
i think it' s a marvellous letter .
we make a good team , don' t we ?
we think the same way .
of course we do .
it' s almost suppertime .
you' re not hungry , are you ?

i only wish i could deliver that letter personally .

turn the light off !

get your pants on !
don' t shout at me .
don' t shove me .
too bad henry wasn' t here .
he' d have thought it was a real radio programme .
i thought it was a radio programme .
we should send a letter of commendation to the armed forces radio network .
ah , wonderful .
yes .
it was the most uplifting programme i have ever heard .
it was climactic .
morning , ladies .
well , hiya , hot lips .
oh .
oh , my goodness , over my ...
i' m so sorry to touch you , but i ...
what' s up with her today ?
i think it' s one of those ladies ' things .
it' s not like her to act like this .
she' s made a ...
bitch .
look at my new flannel sweater .
she' s gonna have a nervous breakdown .
she can' t even get outta the door .
morning , frank .
heard from your wife ?
colonel , you forgot your briefcase .
i left it in the jeep .
you left it there .
oh , yes .
i forgot it .
morning , captain .
i hope you didn' t have to ...
take care of this .
i hope you didn' t have to bother with those shirts .
it wasn' t necessary .
too late , sir .
it' s a done thing .
well , thank you .
morning , padre .
you know , i really got ...
colonel , sir .
how was your visit , sir ?
great .
the general wasn' t there .
oh .
listen , about last night , sir , there was nothing i could do about it , sir .
nothing ?
nothing .
well , it couldn' t have been helped .
thank you , sir .
oh , what' s that ?
frank burns and hawkeye pierce .
very encouraging .
a bunch of the boys asked me to ask you what hot lips was like in the sack .
was she ...
mind your own business .
no , frank .
is she better than self abuse ?
what' s that all about ?
he gonna get some pointers or somethin ' ?
no , hawkeye' s gonna sign him up to make a personal appearance tour in all the camps .
is that a fact ?
can you make out what they' re saying ?
does that big ass of hers move around a lot , frank , or does it sort of lie there flaccid ?
um , hawkeye' s questioning the major on a point of anatomy .
very professional .
would you say that she was a moaner , frank ?
what is burns saying ?
major burns isn' t saying much of anything .
he' s formulating the answer .
seriously , frank .
or does she lie there quiet and not do anything at all ?
keep your filthy mouth to yourself .
oh !
oh !
get him off me !
get him off me !
frank , is that lesson one ?
frank burns has gone nuts !
i' m wearing glasses , for god' s sake !
watch out for your goodies .
he' s a sex maniac .
i don' t think hot lips satisfied him .
don' t let him kiss you , hawkeye .
# the time has come for us

# my heart will always
# be yours for eternity
# i knew sometime we' d have to say sayonara ...

attention .
attention .
this is colonel blake' s office .
the american medical association has just declared marijuana a dangerous drug .
despite earlier claims by physicians that it is no more harmful than alcohol , ... ... this is now found to be the case .
that is all .
when did you get them ?
let me try it on you .
yeah ?
yeah .
hey , dago reddo !
hi .
you' re just in time for cocktails .
come on in .
uh , no , thank you .
i can' t , really .
uh , hawkeye .
hawkeye .
ok , red .
could i speak to you ?
yeah , sure .
no , outside .
what ?
i have to talk to you outside .
hiya , pup pup .
sorry to drag you away from the gang , but ...
what ?
this' il only take a moment .
there' s a problem with walt waldowski .
painless ?
you got a toothache ?
he' s good .
no , no , it' s not my problem .
see , it' s his problem .
um ...
what do you mean ?
what is it ?
well , what is it ...
that' s , um ...
it' s difficult to talk about , you see , because i learned about his problem in confession .
oh , and you can' t ...
i can' t divulge .
can you give me a hint ?
just an idea ?
well , no .
um ...
but i can tell you how serious it is .
um , he and the boys were playing poker ... ... and one of the boys turned to him and asked him for a ruling on one of the hands .
and walt said , uh , he said " what does it matter ?
it' s only a game .
painless said " what does it matter ?
it' s only a game " ?
poker , only a game ?
yeah .
yeah , that' s what i thought .
i guess i better go see a man about a tooth .
thank you .
see , i didn' t know what to ... do .
pup pup .
you see , there are some ...
there are some things that absolution just , uh ...
well ...
seven , eight , jack .
three on a low .
four , three ...
hawkeye , there' s an empty chair here looking for a player .
baby , i' ve got a toothache like you can' t believe .
why do you bring that dog in here ?
last time you did i lost $30 .
why do you have to sit behind me ?
it makes me nervous .
it brings me a lot of luck .
sit there , boone .
come on .
let' s play , men .
deuce .
ace .
can i take some scotch ?
sure .
you want some ?
no .
how you feelin ' ?
no , don' t touch me .
look , if a ...
if a man isn' t a man any more , ... ... what' s he got left that he should be living for ?
ok , tell me about it .
what' s the story ?
well , you know that little nurse that was through here last night with the 325th ?
the little one with the big ... boobs .
yeah , i know .
yeah .
well , anyway , i ...
i wasn' t gonna fool around out here because i got these ...
i got these three girls that i' m engaged to back home .
and you wanted to be faithful .
baby , you are 7, 000 miles from home .
well , anyway , i took her out last night and i ...
i failed .
you mean she wouldn' t put out ?
she wanted to , but it was me .
i couldn' t ...
oh , you couldn' t ...
it wouldn' t ...
yeah , nothing happened .
not at all .
that happens to everybody .
it' s happened to me four or five times ...
yeah , well , it' s never happened to me before .
come on .
you' re the best equipped dentist in the army .
you' re the dental don juan of detroit .
that' s just a cover up .
what' s a cover up ?
don juanism .
i' ve been reading about it .
it' s a cover up .
it' s a cover up for what ?
well ...
i' m a fairy .
a victim of latent homosexuality .
i' ve turned into a fairy .
have you ... have you done anything ?
no , but it' s only a matter of time .
i just can' t face it .
look , hawkeye , suppose that you found out that you were one , huh ?
one ... ?
yeah .
you wouldn' t like telling your wife .
no , i can see that that would be a problem .
i got the same problem , only multiplied .
well , you know , man o' war , ... ... after they retired him from racing , they put him out to stud .
and he had an average of about 120 , ... ... 130 foals every year .
and he lived to be 36 .
and then when he died they did an autopsy and found out that he was a raving queen .
no , that' s a little known fact , but it' s the truth .
painless has a couple of years left in him .
maybe more .
he hasn' t started raving yet .
painless is a dentist , and a dentist shouldn' t read .
that' s his problem .
his problem is that he believes it .
he is convinced .
it' s an obsession and it is a vital force .
here he comes !
the jawbreaker .
he' s not gonna break anything .
just act natural .
all right , painless ?
how' s she goin ' ?
something in a marshmallow ?
no , it' s ok , fellas .
i know you' ve been talking about me , and ...
well , i came over to tell you that i' ve decided that i' m ... ... going to commit suicide .
oh .
well , if you' re really gonna go ahead and do it , ... ... do you think you could leave me your record player ?
oh , sure .
thank you .
gonna miss you , painless .
how do you plan to do it ?
a. 45 between the eyes ?
that' s awful sloppy .
it' s reliable though .
well , that' s another thing i wanted to ask you .
i' m , uh , sort of new at this game and , uh ...
do you have any particular method you' d recommend ?
i don' t know .
i think my colleagues and i could come up with something ... ... to relinquish the vital forces of their ...
black capsule .
black capsule .
of course .
that' s neat .
what' s a black capsule ?
you have any ?
does it work ?
it worked for hitler and eva braun .
it should work for you .
hawkeye , i really must ...
i should check with the military vicar' s office .
i cannot give absolution to a man who is about to commit suicide .
it' s a mortal sin .
look , dago , he is not committing suicide , only intending to .
so you' re not dealing with an act , but with an intention .
if it works , he will not commit suicide , so therefore you' re preventing a mortal sin .
ok ?
well , i should check .
well , you check on it .
well , there' s ...
all right , where you at ?
there you go .
now , then , you' ve all come here to say your final farewell to ol ' walt here .
farewell , walt .
dear ol ' walt .
you know , i got an idea that maybe it' s not such a final farewell after all .
i think maybe ol ' walt' s goin ' on into the unknown to do a little recon work for us all .
huh ?
i just wanna say one thing .
nobody ordered walt to go on this mission .
he volunteered for certain death .
that' s true .
it' s what we award our highest medals for .
that' s beautiful .
that' s what being a soldier is all about .
oh , yeah .
hear !
hear !
yes .
yes .
gentlemen , i think there' s only one person who has anything to add to that .
and that' s dago red .
oh , the padre .
let' s hear it for the padre .
walt , here' s ... here' s your black capsule .
oh .
look , this thing works pretty fast , doesn' t it ?
i think i better go lie down over there .
uh , walt , that' il help you .
# through early morning fog i see
# visions of the things to be
# the pains that are withheld for me
# i realise
# and i can see
# that suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the game of life is hard to play
# i' m going to lose it anyway
# the losing card i' il someday lay
# so this is all i have to say
# that suicide is painless wherever you go , take this .
good luck . # it brings on many changes it' s out there . # and i can take or leave it if i please i' il always remember you just like this .
# the only way to win is cheat
# and lay it down before i' m beat mm hm .
# and to another give my seat
# for that' s the only painless feat
painless .
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes nice party .
thanks for asking me . # and i can take or leave it if i please thing is ... ... you' re throwing your whole education away .
# and you can do good night , jawbreaker .
# the same thing
# if you please
hi , baby .
hi .
i' m glad you could come .
sorry it was so late .
that' s ok .
i really couldn' t sleep anyway .
i' m so nervous .
you leavin ' tomorrow ?
yeah .
i' il be on my way in less than 12 hours .
i suppose who it' s going to be really roughest on though is your husband .
why are you all of a sudden so concerned with him ?
a man would be more considerate to his wife .
he wouldn' t go home a nervous wreck .
stop using logic cos you' re just proving ...
it could be an impersonal thing . ... why i shouldn' t go to bed with you .
i didn' t mean me .
you have the rare privilege that happens to chief executives of states or nations .
you have the privilege of restoring a human being' s life ... ... by a tender act of mercy .
what is this ?
oh , hawkeye , is he dead ?
no , no .
he' s not dead .
not yet .
painless has a psychological problem , and you' re the only person who can help him .
oh , no , hawkeye .
oh , no .
come on .
no , maria .
you' ve gotta look on this as a nurse .
painless needs it for therapeutic value .
it will help him , and it wouldn' t do you any harm either to think about it for a bit .
if you think that your virtue is more important than painless' s life , that' s fine .
i just want you to stay here and be with him for a minute .
just look at him .
just ... ... stay close to the whole man ...
oh , hawkeye !
... and look at him .
hawkeye !
oh , this is ridiculous .
you forgot your hat !
you wouldn' t wanna leave without a souvenir .
have a good trip .
lieutenant schneider , you forgot your travelling orders .
wait .
you' re supposed to pick ...
these are your travelling orders .
morning , painless .
oh , hi , hawkeye .
how' s she goin ' ?
slept like a doll last night .
hm .
well , can' t waste time .
big day .
got two jaws to rebuild .
come on , seidman .
have a good day .
attention .
attention .
religious services for yom kippur will be held ... will not be held this friday , ... ... due to mitigating circumstances .
for those who wish to observe said holiday , sunday has been reserved .
that is all .
trapper , this one' s for you , babe .
that man is a prisoner of war , doctor .
so are you , but you don' t know it .
it' s in pretty deep .
i think that was my finger .
i need your help , hawkeye .
it' s hit more than a lung .
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
hey , radar .
yes .
has that a negative come in from seoul ?
we keep ordering it , but it never arrives .
how' d the kid take the induction , ugly ?
good .
he' s ready .
pickups and irrigation , please .
give me some gel foam .
not now , honey .
go back to sleep .
scissors .
sponge .
more sponges .
let' s have the suction up here .
thank you .
rib spreader .
clamp .
let' s give him a sexy scar , huh ?
fantastic .
lot of blood .
sponge .
scissors .
watch it .
give me something to stuff it in with .
pickups for me .
how' s he tolerating this ?
good .
he' s young .
things get slippery .
ouch !
you' re a backhanded guy .
let me have the forceps and a sponge stick .
hot lips , you may be a pain in the ass , but you' re a damn good nurse .
thanks , trapper .
put enough blood in him , john .
there' s a clot on the cava above the atrium .
must be the point of entry .
clamp .
i feel a fragment right underneath the clot .
you control the cava .
ok .
we gotta stop that spurting .
clamp .
do what ?
stop the spurting .
that' s a very good technical term .
christ .
it' s not in the cava .
it' s in the pulmonary artery on the left side .
ok .
let me close him up and sit on it for ...
we can' t sit on it .
what if we' re jammed up ?
we don' t have the blood !
if you cut again , you' il lose him .
look , hawkeye , the artery can erode .
now' s the time to take our shot .
a negative .
you said you didn' t have any blood .
i found a donor .
up close , all crumpled up like that , they don' t look like much , you know .
was he loaded or empty when he crashed ?
he was loaded , but it didn' t matter much .
you see , the two guys he was carrying were dead already .
what about the pilot ?
pilot' s fine .
took off a kneecap and he lost the function in his right hand , but he' s great .
i didn' t hear .
what colour was her hair ?
black , shiny .
shiny , black hair .
black ?
you like black ?
i ...
i' m kind of partial to blonde myself .
i knew it .
i knew you had an attraction for hot lips houlihan .
hear !
hear !
go to hell , captain pierce .
you know i damn near puke every time i look at her .
' sides , i' il bet she' s not a real blonde .
how dare you say that about an officer of the united states army , sir ?
i' il not only say it , but i' il back it with 20 bucks .
how' s that ?
you have yourself a bet , sir .
you' re my witness .
ok , but who' s gonna be the poor schmuck who finds out ?
well , i could , if no one else wants ...
i ...
no , no .
we , uh ...
we gotta all see it together somehow .
it' s five minutes after the time the nurses shower .
where are they ?
they will be here .
finest kind , ho jon .
what' s happening ?
radar ...

you don' t know about the papers the colonel left ?
why didn' t you tell me about the papers ?
i tried to .
uh , uh .

evelyn , could you give me a hand ?
sure .
hey , frankie , could you take a look at my corns , please ?

oh !
that' s it !
major , what went on ?
where' s blake ?
you can' t see colonel blake .
you shut up , you twerp !
this isn' t a hospital !
it' s an insane asylum !
and it' s your fault because you don' t do anything to discourage them !
what do you want me to do ?
put them under arrest !
see what a court martial thinks of their drunken hooliganism !
first they called me hot lips , and you let them get away with it !
and then you let them get away with everything !
and if you don' t turn them over to the mp this minute , ... ... i ...
i' m gonna resign my commission !
goddammit , hot lips , resign your goddamn commission .
my commission !

well , my mother' s dead actually .
oh .
well , i' m sorry .
uh ...
i' d like to say hello to my father , if i could .
yeah , yeah , fine .
hi , dad .
excuse me .
i am making an examination of this young man ... ... to find out if he would be a soldier in our army .
yeah , i know .
hi , ho jon .
how' s she goin ' , boy ?
his heartbeat is much too fast ... ... and his blood pressure is dangerously high .
oh , yeah ?
oh .
i guess you think he' s unfit for the army , eh ?
yes , at first .
but when i saw on his paper he worked in an american hospital ... ... where there are many drugs and he could have taken some by mistake .
what would he do a thing like that for ?
who knows ?
to find the truth i will keep him here for a couple of days .
by tomorrow his fast heart and high blood pressure may be gone .
look ...
so i suggest you say goodbye to him now .
doctor , i' ve ...
it was a nice try .
come on , ho jon .
hey .
oh , man !
this is brought to you through radio tokyo ... ... by courtesy of the veterans of foreign wars , post number 63 of sedalia , missouri .

and he' s still at lunch .
mother , i wanna go to work in one hour .
we are the pros from dover ... ... and we figure to crack this kid' s chest and go play golf before it gets dark .
so find the gas passer , have him premedicate the patient , ... ... then bring me the latest pictures on him .
the ones we saw were old .
then tell the kitchen to rustle us up lunch .
ham would be fine .
steak would be better .
then get one nurse who knows how to work in close without getting her tits in my way .
oh !
oh , you fool .
how do you want your steak cooked ?
towel .
say the magic words , you make a hundred dollars .
all right !
i demand an explanation .

thanks for the drink .
thank you .
what the hell you ... ?
sir , ever since the dark days before pearl harbor , i' ve been proud to wear this uniform .
what the hell is this ?
a helicopter .
that man has five times the manpower to draw on than we do .

we get henry to apply , make a specific application for a neurosurgeon .
he asks for dr oliver harmon jones .
dr oliver harmon jones ?
oh , he' s , uh ...
who is oliver harmon jones ?
he is better known as spearchucker jones .
he' s a good ballplayer .
yes !
that negro boy , played with the 49ers .
sure .
sure , i remember .
he' s good .
henry , if we had closer relations , we wouldn' t have this misunderstanding , right ?
now , that' s where a football game would help between your outfit and mine .
a football game ?
we put up a few bets , five thousand maybe , and have a little fun .
special services in tokyo says it' s one of our best gimmicks ... ... to keep the american way of life going in asia .
betting ?
no !
football .
but what about major o' houlihan ?
you mean hot lips ?
screw her !
it' s a helicopter , general .
i know it' s a helicopter !
uh , i just wondered about the social problem , you know .
i mean , he' s the only negro officer in the whole camp , you know .
we got a problem , we' il stick him in with us , baby boy .
you' re serious , ain' t you ?
sure , i' m serious .
i ...
i ...
i ...
it' s enough for me to have to put up with you two yankees , but i' m , you know , that' s ...
because of his wife , or was it a religious problem ?
it was a conditioning problem .
why you called spearchucker ?
i used to throw the javelin .
oh .
right , we' re not here to sell lemonade , we' re here to practise .
but first let' s welcome spearchucker .
is it all right to call you that ?
call me whatever you want .
i want you to know we' re all the same here on the playing field , officers and men alike .
now , we' re going to begin with the three basic principles : organisation , discipline and teamwork .
now ...
pardon me .
mind if we limber up first ?
that' s a good idea .
you organise that .
# move that line , hey !
hold that line , hey !
all right , seidman , keep ' em pushin ' that whatever you call it .
that' s good .
all right , hot lips , keep their arms and limbs moving .
radar , you' re a coach .
you' re not a corporal , you' re a coach , ... ... so keep them going through there .
good , hot lips .
all right , seidman , give ' em five .
all right , men , take five .
spearchucker .
we look pretty lousy , don' t we ?
for college players that have been out of training for seven years , yeah , you do .
i got an idea how we can make some money .
we leave him out of the first half .
we bet half our money .
they roll up some points , ok ?
second half we stick him in .
we get odds from them .
we bet the other half .
we clean up .
good thinking , captain .
sounds good to me .
oh , and i had another idea .
i think we should have some plays .
usually in football you have organised plays .
well , if you don' t mind , i took the liberty .
oh , you have .
i drew up seven or eight plays .
oh , these are good .
i think that' s all this bunch can handle .
oh , very good .
yes .
oh , very , very good .
uh , what are these little arrows ?
right into his hands !
well , it' s only six points .
six points !
it' s only one point .
one point !
who' s that number one ?
we can' t stop him .
they call him super bug .
he had one year with the rams .
we can' t do anything with him in there .
you gotta come in .
we can' t wait .
no , we stick to our strategy , but you gotta get him out of the ball game .
hey , davidson !
here !
let' s ease up just a little bit .
we don' t want the score too lopsided .
go !
go !
he caught it !
who' s he giving it to ?
isn' t that corporal judson ?
judson' s a lineman !
judson can' t run !
for crying out loud , judson , what' re you doin ' ?
duke , you threw me that ball !
you had the field open !
why' d you fall ?
i' m no goddamn runner , i' m a lineman .
we' re gonna really clean up today .
ah , it' s only two points .
two points .
what d' you think you are , a cannon ?
what kind of a snap was that ?
we got a lot of money on this game .
this is embarrassing !
let' s go !
yeah !
what happens now ?
we get a free kick .
a free kick !

he played with san francisco before he got drafted .
he' s gonna be tough to stop , too .
henry , you brought in a ringer , did you ?
radar , what' s the general trying to say ?
didn' t bring him in in the first half !
he' s just been informed as to the identity of our spearchucker .
his ringer' s spotted our ringer .
how do you like them apples , charlie ?
you can' t trust anybody .
now watch him make the extra point .
isn' t that illegal ?
