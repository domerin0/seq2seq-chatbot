my brother metacomet , may the noble spirit ofyourfather , massasoit , soar with the eagles .
chief metacomet .
thanks to the friendship of your father , we have survived here .
my father should have let you die !
you are the only one who comes to us with an open heart .
but your people have murdered my father with their lies !
my name is pearl .
this is the story of my mother , hesterprynne .
it was the yearofourlord 1666 , when she arrived in the massachusetts bay colony filled with the hope that at last , in this new world would come the freedom to worship without fearofpersecution .
my esteemed colleague !
thy years of toil become thee !
thy fame preceeds thee , sir .
governor bellingham , may i present the reverend thomas cheever .
welcome , sir .
it' s a long voyage .
3 months at sea , will either take away your faith , or harden it to iron .
allow me to introduce a woman who' s been travelling with us ,
mistress ...
hester prynne .
i apologize for the coarseness of my hands , mistress .
but here in the colonies , everyone must work .
i look forward to the hard work .
i will triumph in the work of thy hands " .
thou canst quote the scriptures .
aye , reverendo , both testaments .
my husband taught me .
you must rest .
then i' il show you what' s been accomplished .
i thank thee .
then it' s goodwife prynne .
yes , yes .
but i prefer to be called hester .
welcome , hester .
i wish i could' ve seen it before , when it was wild and untouched .
madam , you should use less lace in your dressmaking .
lndeed , reverend .
master of us all , we give thanks for another bountiful meal , and for newly arrived disciples , that share it with us this night .
amen .
amen .
so , governor .
i am impatient to know how you fared with metacomet .
well , metacomet isn' t massassoit , major dunsmuir .
but if we respect the agreements we made with his father , we' ve nothing to fear .
so we don' t grow complacent , our wise god sends us a sign .
when we sailed , your letters said we were at peace with the savage .
well ,
i fear the days of " peace " with the wampanoag is at an end .
major , we are frightening our new arrival .
we hear much of your success with the praying lndians .
i' m very eager to meet reverend dimmesdale and his converts .
the runts of the litter .
dimmesdale' s little treasures !
some of us have other opinions .
mistress prynne ,
i hope you' il stay with us until your husband' s arrival .
you' re most kind , but i intend to find a house of my own as soon as possible .
on thine own ?
why , yes .
it' s not considered fitting for a young woman to live alone .
i' ve come first to prepare a place for his arrival , so that is what i intend to do .
mistress prynne .
the rules we live by may seem arbitrary to a newcomer , but we have learnt the hard way that without absolute order , we cannot hope to survive here .
rules , mistress prynne .
order .
survival .
would you have me disobey my husband ?
i ...
reverend , you might enjoy the company of my son , brewster .
he studied divinity .
harvard wasn' t good enough for him , so he came home to make his fortune as a ...
minister' s sons all moaning the lord' s prayer in their sleep .
everyone must find his place .
morning , mistress prynne .
good morrow .
so you intend on scandalising the town !
get up !
good !
i confess ,
i feel alone in a sea of conformists .
where should we begin our search ?
on the cliffs by the sea .
no , it' s out of the question .
why ?
no one' s lived by the sea since the lndians wiped out ballinger' s point .
i say we start there .
well , if you' ve decided .
ls that it , brewster ?
it' s beautiful .
i tried to imagine what herlife was like before she came to the new world .
why did herhusband send heron ahead , alone ?
was it a test ofherloyalty , orherspirit ?
or was it in his nature to set traps forpeople in the hope they would fall into them ?
it' s perfect !
with a cart and a musket , i could have a home here !
a cart , a horse , a pitchfork , a plow .
i can think of better things to do with these pretty hands than grow calluses on them .
i' il need indentured labor , at least two men .
the land needs draining .
you are headstrong .
perhaps it runs in the blood .
i' m told your father was too .
ls it true he was in debt to your husband and you were the payment ?
i' ve said something to disturb you .
i' m sorry .
i' m truly sorry .
god , thou art wondrous fair !
that hurt !
good .
it' il remind you not to do it again .
faith ?
prudence ?
did you hear mistress prynne has a bathing tub ?
what is she , french ?
2 shillings .
will you bid 2 shillings ?
2 and a half ?
come on , gentlemen , do i have a bid for 3 shillings ?
3 shillings ?
3 shillings ?
anyone else ?
anyone else ?
going for 3 shillings .
any other bids ?
sold to the gentleman for 3 shillings .
next we have this other one , those two .
how much time left on their indenture ?
about 3 years , but , shouldn' t your husband or father be doing business with me ?
ls my money no good to you , sir ?
your money' s as fine as wine in the sunshine , mistress .
lf you buy them at a just price , i' il throw in the girl in red .
she' s a slave !
but she don' t speak , if that be a problem .
born that way .
name your just price .
we' d best accompany you if your going to the forest .
don' t worry mr bobbin .
i shan' t go far .
mistress prynne ?
mistress prynne ?
mistress prynne ?
where are you ?
mistress prynne , where are you ?
i found her .
you did not .
i did to .
you did not .
i did to .
mistress prynne ,
have you forgotten it is the sabbath ?
of course not .
forgive me .
we' ve come by especially to bring you to church .
thank you , so much .
please , go on without me .
i will follow at once .
make haste .
yes , sir .
all right , girl ,
come on .
oh goodnes !
back up .
back up .
come on now , back up .
come on .
come on .
back up .
good morrow .
may i be of assistance ?
not from up there .
come on .
come on .
steady .
steady .
i can' t make this horse understand me .
let me try .
come on , girl .
come on , back up !
come on , girl .
come on .
come on .
i' m afraid you' re in too deep .
she' il not make it .
let me try this .
i do hope you can get it free .
i' m already late for the service , and everyone' s talking about me .
i' ve been away and i' m quite behind on local gossip .
i bought the old newbury place out on ballinger' s point .
then ,
i owe you an apology .
i' ve been trespassing .
there' s a place at the point where i like to bath .
really ?
well , i shan' t charge too steep a tariff .
come on , girl , back up !
back up .
one ,
two ,
two .
three .
i' m afraid this cart will be stuck here until sabbath next unless i gather hands to help .
would you care to ride with me ?
on your horse , with you ?
aye , unless you can ride .
i can ride .
you take my horse and i' il take yours .
there' s a shortcut to the meeting house , but it' s a difficult road .
i shall manage , sir .
are you certain ?
just you lead the way .
come on !
come on !
come on !
come on !
may god be with you .
i' m sure he already is .
but aren' t you coming to ...
good sabbath to ye all .
friends , and fellow voyagers , in the greatest of all dreams .
we' ve been singled out , like lsrael of old , to serve as a model .
but if we are to succeed in building our new jerusalem , our " city on a hill " , then the power of love , yea , his divine love , we must bind our hearts as one !
here ... is the measure of perfection !
here ,
lives god' s own !
but we are not succeeding in that test .
we are failing !
and why ?
because we covet , nay , we lust after what is not ours .
be it for the rich land of our lndian brothers , be it for glory , for profits or for revenge .
need i read the secret of every heart ?
i will if you want .
yea , i will if you want .
i will lay open the secrets before the eyes of god !
what thou lusteth after is my enemy , sayeth the lord god .
for only i shall consume thee , only i shall fill thee up .
lf thou failest to heed my commandments , then my fist shall descend on thee like a stone !
and thy sword shall cut thee into bloody parts , and even thy memories shall be sacrificed to the winds for all time !
may god bless you , each and every one of you .
amn .
amn .
allow me to present a newcomer to our congregation ,
mistress roger prynne .
mistress roger ?
aye , her husband , a renowned physician will join her before ...
reverednd dimmesdale and i have already ...
i helped when her cart got stuck in the woods .
i greatly enjoyed your sermon .
it' s rare for a man so young to speak with such passion .
for some reason ,
i felt most inspired today .
we welcome you and your husband to our congregation .
mother !
mother !
there you are , hester .
meet my friend , running moose .
he' s our schoolmaster .
and i' m sure you' d like some refreshment .
do you teach the english children as well mr running moose ?
they call me john or johnny here .
we try our best , but the english are a bit slow witted .
slow witted ?
johnny' s a bit of a jester , but he was our first praying lndian .
my best friend in the colony .
arthur ,
this is mistress ...
we' ve already met .
excuse me .
so like home .
yet beyond those trees i suspect a savagery , of savage passions , dark and untamed .
reverend dimmesdale , have you met our young friend ?
yes , we' ve met .
mistress prynne and i traveled out on the same ship .
i' m going to marry him one day .
no you' re not , i' m going to aren' t i mistress prynne ?
marry whom ?
reverend dimmesdale , of course !
a short description of the great and last judgement " .
well , " platform for church discipline " .
they' re all tracts !
the goodwife' s manual ... " for animal husbandry
i believe we' ve already met .
oh , yes , i ...
i' m sorry , i didn' t realize .
i should have announced my presence .
what are you reading ?
" comus " , it' s by john john milton .
i know it .
i' ve read it .
have you ?
i' m not all counterpanes and coverlets .
every spare moment , i read .
i' m the same .
i' ve read every book in this room .
some of them several times .
even " manual for animal husbandry ?
a most exhiliarating read .
so , did you truly enjoy my sermon ?
yes , it was most skilful .
clearly your congregation reverences you .
you liked it not .
we don' t come up to london standards .
to the contrary .
i was moved by your passion .
and ?
well ,
when your fist struck your hand , and sliced through the air like a sword ,
i found myself wondering what manner of pain lay beneath such forceful oratory .
your tongue knows no rules , mistress prynne .
and if it did , reverend , what purpose would it serve ?
and here i thought comprehending god was to be my greatest challenge .
yes , reverend ?
this morning in the forest , why did you not say you were married ?
why did you not say you were a minister ?
good day , mistress prynne .
good morrow , mistress prynne .
good morrow .
you care for a cup of cider ?
we are your neighbours , it seems .
did you like the sermon this morning ?
from where i sat it seemed it did please thee .
i liked it very much .
i thought the young minister very ...
handsome ?
harriet hibbons .
ruth ?
how do you do ?
come and meet some of the others who were not invited to the governer' s shindig .
sally short , mistress prynne .
how do you do ?
i was on the dock when you arrived .
mary rollins .
mary don' t like to speak much .
she' s only been free from the savages this half year .
and matona don' t trust the english , do you dear ?
mistress prynne ?
thank you , no .
i never imbibe .
you' ve gathered some fine balm of gilead ,
shepherd' s purse , yarrow .
you know your plants ?
i do .
i recite " culpepper " by heart .
really ?
then what would you use to heal a bad burn ?
i' ve seen sweet fern work miracles , but culpepper suggests blackberry and red cedar .
well , you hear that .
my husband has a very large library and i was able to school myself .
how do you like our new jerusalem ?
sober enough for you ?
aye , sober enough .
what i miss is the dancing .
dancing ?
when first we came , they' d be dancing round the maypole .
feast days we' d sing bawdy songs .
people weren' t afraid to play the fool .
we' d teach the bears to dance .
now days , everybody getting more and more sourfaced and ponderous .
and a whipping post stands where the mayppole used to be .
but there' s a few of us who haven' t forgotten to laugh .
it' s been a pleasure meeting you all .
i' m sorry i must take my leave , but i don' t want to be stuck in the wilds at night .
there are things that sound to me , the wilds at night are my natural territory .
particulary when there' s a full moon .
do you try to frighten me with this witch talk ?
not so , mistress prynne .
but i can see what others cannot .
be a curse , to be sure , but i know the hearts of men .
and what does my heart tell you ?
you' re a most comely woman .
let a man tremble who wins the hand of a maid , but possesses not the full passion of her heart .
my husband has nothing to fear .
good day mistress hibbons .
good day , mistress prynne .
good day , goody gotwick .
i brought these for reverend dimmesdale .
the reverend be occupied with his work , missus .
leave them books on the table and i' il be sure he gets them .
good morrow , reverend .
good morrow , mistress prynne .
knowing you hunger for new reading ,
i brought you some books .
how courteous of you .
please .
i must apologize for my forthrightness on sabbath last .
i' ve earned a few reprimands for speaking too bluntly .
i owe an apology , too .
i can' t understand why i took such offence to such a simple comment .
but i have wondered how you were able to see so deeply into my nature .
perhaps i' m a witch .
i must be keeping you from your chores .
thank you for the books .
good day .
i' m sorry .
my hands are covered in ink .
i' ve been hovered over my translations all day .
translations ?
aye .
i' m attempting to translate the bible into the local lndian language ,
algonquin .
what an ambitious undertaking .
but i' m told the lndians don' t want to be guided by our bible .
that war with them is inevitable .
some think that way , but they' re wrong .
the lndians , born from a certain liberty , take not easily to bridle and bit .
no man should .
well ...
what ?
what ?
you keep putting ink on your face .
oh , i do .
there you are .
i do hope you enjoy the books .
thank you .
good day .
good day .
mituba ?
' tis only a bathing tub , not a toy of satan .
mistress prynne ?
reverend dimmesdale !
you frightened me .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to .
it' s a wonderful surprise .
it' s beautiful .
yes , and frightening .
just as eden must have been .
so untouched .
does it not cry out with it' s promise , that everything can begin anew ?
i brought back your books .
you couldn' t have read them all in four days .
oh no , i did .
i read most of them twice .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
farewell .
hester ...
i' m not the man i seem .
i' ve lived here all my life , my purpose clear .
but now i' d risk everything , my life , my ministry , my soul just to spend a few moments alone with you .
god help me , hester .
i love thee .
god help me .
i love thee too .
oh god .
have we lost our way ?
no !
i dreamed of thee speaking thy heart .
i have prayed for it even as i have dreaded it .
was i alive before i laid eyes on thee ?
what shall we do ?
i know not .
say something to end it , for i have not the power .
nor l .
nay !
we could be hanged for this .
i' ve put you in too much danger , and i must end it by walking away and never speaking with you again .
go then .
do as you promised .
throughout the long summer , mistress prynne and the reverend avoided each other at all costs .
mistress prynne rarely went to town and the reverend escaped to the wilds with the indians and faithful johnny sassamon forcompany .
and the colony organized it' s annual election day as usual .
no one the wiser that there existed among them two hearts struggling against a love that grew stronger with each passing day .
johnny sassamon says they' ve attacked the " lntrepid " .
what' s he saying ,
arthur ?
the tarrantines attacked an english ship , the lntrepid .
all were massacred .
prynne " .
doctor roger prynne " .
mistress prynne .
i' m here as your minister .
come in .
there was an attack , an lndian attack on one of our ships .
they say that , all aboard were massacred .
i regret to be ... the one to bring you this sad news .
i' il leave you to your mourning .
are you certain none survived ?
they say that the tide washed away the bodies .
god forgive me !
i' ve prayed so long to be set free .
you did not cause his death , hester .
god ... took your husband .
but was it an answer to my prayers ?
does he work like that ?
perhaps .
lf in his eyes there was no other way we could be together .
i must know what the law is .
the mourning , how long must one wait ?
1 month ?
six months ?
what ?
where there is no absolute proof of death ,
7 years must pass before we' re free to be seen in public .
7 years ?
yes ...
greetings , metacomet .
we have been enemies .
but now tarrantine and wampanoag must unite to fight the greedy english .
before theypush us into the sea .
were the lndians cruel to you , mary ?
after my little one died , they treated me fair and square .
lf truth be told , cruel is how you folks have treated me since i come home .
thank you .
i didn' t do nothing that wasn' t forced on me !
the thought of being taken by a savage makes me sick to my stomach .
well , they do it on the backs of their horses , ridin ' across the land .
hester , you all right ?
yes , i' m just tired .
mary' s right .
you call them savages .
i could tell you a thing or two about your husband before he tied the knot with you .
stupid slut !
harold would never had nothing to do with no whore !
you think not ?
i' ve even seen one of your windy ministers pokin ' an lnjun girl , standin ' on a bible so he could roger her better .
they always said the scriptures should uplift you !
i refuse to be with those who would mock the holy book !
well , she' il not be coming back soon .
good riddance to her !
we quakers believe that the scriptures be not religion , but only the ceremony and history of it .
i agree .
for are not the laws of men but the imagination of mortals , and the inner spirit the true voice of heaven ?
hester ,
i pray you' re not sayin ' you talk directly to the deity ?
don' t you know that only paid bible thumpers can do that ?
have a care , child , or they' il talking of you the way they talk of me !
i know some consider it blasphemous to say this , but i do talk to god .
i have since i was a small child .
and he answers me .
mistress roger prynne ... by order of the governor of masachusetts bay colony , you are ordered to appear before the magistrates at eight tomorrow morn !
don' t be tardy !
mistress prynne , these gentlemen have laid a charge ofheresy againstyou .
tell me how it is the laws ofmen are the imagination ofmortals ?
it is the meetings thatyou call heresy .
lascivious talk offornication with savages .
fallen women who tell lies about good citizens .
this is what comes when there is no qualified man present to guide these women in their untutored chatterings .
lf the discourse of women is untutored chattering , why does the bible teach that women shall be the teachers of women ?
hester , we ask that you cease these meetings .
no , sirs .
i' il not stop the meetings .
arthur .
please join us .
i' ve been fishing , sir ..
you may thank me to remain where i am .
please be seated .
call our first witness .
ls it truly of import ?
yes , it is of great consequence .
very well , call your witness .
goody gotwick ?
stand up , goody .
you revealed to my wife something very disturbing .
tell me , what does it mean when a woman vomits in the morning hours ?
and vomits more than once in the morning hours ?
i only saw her the one time .
yes .
and ?
goody mortimer saw her get sick in the market .
are you with child ?
answer your betters , woman !
do you carry a bastard child in yur womb ?
yes .
who is the father ?
you are innocent next to the one who would hide behind your skirts .
we would hang that fornicator !
i' il not reveal the name , sir .
i will tell you his name !
his name is lucifer !
his name is legion !
his name is lust !
gentlemen ,
what do you hope to accomplish ?
you know there is no law against pregnancy .
but there is against adultery .
it would only adultery if her husband were found to be alive .
the meetings will stop !
governor , if you knew the name of this man , would you punish hester prynne ?
has she confessed the name to you ?
i' ve confessed nothing !
tell us the truth , arthur .
he knows nothing of my affairs .
he speaks as my pastor to spare me your harsh hand .
but i fear not your punishments !
i love and honor the man who has fathered this child !
and say what you will , he is my true husband for life , and i shall furnish no information which might cause him harm .
very well , you leave me no choice .
you' re under arrest .
ls this your new jerusalem ?
let me have a moment alone with the woman .
i can draw the name from her .
you shall have your chance .
gentlemen .
i' ve considered all the arguments and decided arthur is allowed to speak to mistress prynne alone .
hester prynne , place your hand on the good book .
let us pray .
let us pray .
why did you not tell me ?
i was afraid .
i thought if i worked hard , i would miscarry .
i must go to bellingham with the truth .
no , you must not !
you are a saint to these people !
they' il hang you for betraying them !
i prefer to hang , than allow you to suffer for me .
they' ve no case against me !
when they tire , they' il release me .
i know stonehall .
you' ve challenged him , and he' il not release you until you are humbled and have recanted your sins .
do you believe we' ve sinned ?
i know not .
what happen between us had a consecration .
have you forgotten ?
i' ve not forgotten !
arthur , i know you want to speak out .
your nature cries out for it .
but you risk your own ruin and deny me my right to stand up to this hypocrisy .
soldier !
lf i need you to speak ,
i' il tie this handkerchief from the window .
i love thee woman , but your strength frightens me .
i' il do what you ask .
amen .
god be with you .
i' m sure he already is .
gentlemen ,
mistress prynne has been there more than 5 months without any legal justification .
even in plymouth they regard this as barbaric !
i' d like to free her .
at home , i have no peace on this .
but the people see us go to her week after week , caps in hand , only to be turned away .
the woman is unrepentant !
she' s fortunate we haven' t beaten her publicly !
i' m surprised at you reverend .
you came here a man of reason .
i came here expecting some semblance of order .
lnstead i find a den of fractiousness !
sir , if you do not stem this dissent , my wife and i will return to england .
and take our parishioners !
lf only she would give us a small sign of contrition .
ifit had been up to him , my father , he would have ended it and revealed the truth ofmy origins .
but bound by my mother' s wish , he could not .
he went every day to see her and was refused .
his eye everon that window forhersign that it was time to come forward with the truth .
had there been flashes ofprynne' s unstable nature before in england ?
no one knows .
but now , free from puritan society , he was increasingly seized by spirits so powerful they were terrifying even to the indians .
he has a ghost in him .
he' il bring us bad luck .
send him home .
forgive me , lord , fori have turned from my heavenly father .
forgive me .
lord , bring me back to thy bosom .
god' s teeth , child !
how could they leave you thus ?
i' m so glad you' re here !
6 months and not one visitor .
some of us came , my dear , but we were turned away .
your slave came every day .
how quick are the pains ?
they' re not stopping .
here .
take a sip of this .
i wager you won' t refuse my cider this time .
rvd .
dimmesdale tried always to get you freed .
another ?
yes .
all right , breathe deep .
breathe deep .
hold on to me !
good girl !
easy , easy .
let me see .
all' s well .
all' s well .
it' s close .
it' s very close .
come , my dear .
it' s time .
up you sit .
good girl .
there .
move down a little .
good .
this child is ready to be born .
we' ve work to do !
there .
how could they keep me here so long ?
well , i' il say this , you must have a will of iron .
when you take on the men , it leads to death .
all right , my dear .
chin down and bear down hard !
more and harder !
harder !
good !
good girl .
that' s it .
easy .
easy .
good .
easy .
are you sure god' s not punishing me ?
to be sure he' s punishing you .
he be giving you a child ! .
now .
gently .
now the head is coming .
the head is through .
just a little more .
easy .
easy .
easy .
she' d here !
oh , thank you , god !
yes !
little pearl .
yes !
yes !
harriet , she' s here !
she' s here .
sit there , mistress .
proceed , reverend .
i' il have them fetch fresh clothes for you and the babe .
i bring good news .
i' ve prevailed upon the governor .
you are to be freed .
but by law ... you' il be brought to the scaffold for reprimand .
hester .
whatever is said , please , be as contrite as your conscience permits .
lf not for my sake , for the babe' s .
i beg you , don' t anger them further !
i' ve come to baptize the babe .
i' ve died not seeing you .
i came every day .
i baptize this child ,
pearl .
pearl .
ln the name of the father , and the son , and the holy ghost .
may the lord bless thee , and care for thee , and watch over thee .
amen .
freeing this woman is an invitation to every wife to defy her husband .
every child it' s parent !
no , she should be released .
what ?
you don' t put her in prison , you put the prison in her .
so each time someone sees her , her sin will be marked into her soul afresh .
cunningly contrived , my dear .
make way in the king' s name .
a blessing on the righteous colony of massachusetts , where iniquity is dragged into the sunlight !
know ye that mistress roger prynne has been ordered to bear punishment for fornication and adultery .
lf it be determined later that her husband be still alive , she may face a most severe penalty , which is to be hanged by the neck until dead .
pray , silence , for his excellency , the governor .
hester prynne , though you show no modesty in you apparel , yet you have a chance , still , to repent your sins .
yes , hester , repent !
child , don' t you believe you have sinned ?
i believe i have sinned in your eyes , but who is to know if god shares your views ?
woman , transgress not the limits of heaven' s mercy !
reverend dimmesdale , you are her pastor .
speak to her for all our sakes !
soften her , her hardness her obstinacy !
listen to the reverend !
speak to the woman , my brother .
exalt her to confess the truth !
hester prynne , you hear what these good men say , and see the accountablity under which i labor .
for your soul' s peace ,
i charge thee speak out the name of your fellow sinner .
be not silent for some mistaken pity or tenderness for him .
for believe me , if he could step down and stand beside you on your pedestal of shame , it would be better than to carry a guilty heart through life .
what can your silence do for him , except to tempt him ?
and compel him to add hypocrisy to sin ?
speak .
she will not speak .
ln the name of the lord , name him !
name him !
his name !
what is his name ?
who might he be ?
very well .
beadle !
mistress , if you do not speak out his name , wear upon your bodice this symbol of your sinful fornication .
heed not this final warning , and you will be a pariah , cut off , shunned and reviled by every man , woman and child in this town !
why do you wait ?
put it on !
it is not a badge of my shame , but your own !
what do you want ?
have i changed so much , my beloved , that you would slay me as i resurrect myself from the dead ?
roger ?
hester .
was i ever unkind to you ?
did i not love thee ?
did i not see thee above all womanhood ?
are you not bound to me by sacred oath ?
or has this new land turned thee into a heathen ?
lay our bed will thou , wife .
pray for thy sins , hester prynne .
beg the lord to forgive thy corruption .
pray and i' il wash thee as white as snow .
white as snow , my love .
white as snow .
white as snow .
arthur ?
hester ?
thank god you' re here !
why are you taking this risk ?
i had to warn you .
my husband is alive .
dear god !
alive ?
now we' il hang for certain .
why would he show up at this moment if he wasn' t god' s dark messenger , sent to punish us .
arthur , you must leave without us .
i cannot bear to see you trapped here , under his watchful eye forever .
hester , i must stay and watch over you and pearl .
no .
you don' t know him .
he' il wait for us to betray each other with the slightest glance or the merest gesture .
please .
you must go !
this god' s punishment , because we tried to run from his will .
i will not say farewell , hester .
pray god watch over you .
and so will l .
kiss pearl for me each night .
' tis easy to see the mother' s part in her .
ls it beyond research , i wonder , to analyze her nature , and from it' s make and mold , give a shrewd guess as to the father ?
what are your expectations ?
i do not expect your heart to return to you quickly .
but i hope one day you will draw me again into your heart .
love has forced me to open my heart to another .
watch your tongue , woman !
' tis this phantom lover who puts these words into your mouth1
where is he ?
ls his kiss still wet on your lips , on your breast ?
i demand to know !
lf i spent 6 months in a cold jail , and did not tell these iron men , what makes you think i' il tell you now ?
these trials have made me strong !
and i am not the child you married !
why not announce yourself openly and cast me off at once .
no , no .
i seek no vengeance against you .
but the man lives who wronged us both .
he bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment .
but i shall read it on his heart .
breathe one word to him of my true identity , and you will both hang .
lf you try to escape , you will be easily found .
easily !
from the savages
i have learned patience ,
hester prynne .
goody gotwick , thank you .
reverend , allow me to introduce our newest boarder ,
doctor chilling ...
chillingworth .
chillingworth .
good day , man .
good day , sir .
what brings you to our colony , sir ?
i' m a physician , sir .
i would cleanse the ills of the community .
have i said something strange ?
no .
i' m amazed .
we have prayed for a skilled physician .
i see you are translating the bible into algonquin .
a most difficult tongue to master .
lf i can be of help , reverend .
i am fluent in algonquin .
fluent ?
yes .
i was a prisoner of the tarrantine .
when i spoke improperly , i was whipped .
i learned quite rapidly .
how were you captured ?
i was working my farm in virginia .
they came , killed my wife , eleanor , god rest her soul , and our infant son , and sold me into captivity .
it' s a wonder you' re not consumed with bitterness and despair .
no , no . ln truth , i am indebted to the lndians .
some say they are savages , but true savagery ,
i find resides elsewhere .
mistress roger prynne .
mistress prynne .
and what is your duty , boy ?
follow you around , mistress .
well , at least they' il make a path for me .
whore !
god will punish you , sinner !
jezebel !
you' re not welcome here !
be gone , hester prynne !
soap , please .
three pieces .
although he wore no outward symbol ofhis shame , my father wore his own scarlet letteron the bosom ofhis soul .
the pain oftheirseparation must have affected us all .
i was a troublesome child .
my fatherached formy mother , and filled his loneliness in the wilds with johnny .
they struggled to keep alive theirdream ofbuilding a bridge between english and indian .
johnny , why are they so close to town ?
they say our people have fallen asleep .
so they must remain awake for all of us .
i' m worried .
ls war coming ?
the great experiment is not working , is it ?
yes , he' s right .
lf there' s war , what is to stop our praying lndians from rising up and slitting our throats as we sleep ?
faith , thomas .
faith .
i know what will stop them .
arthur' s friendship with johnny sassamon .
johnny would never betray arthur .
he worships him .
as peter worshipped
jesus .
gentlemen .
doctor .
lf there' s a true war ,
god help us all . for neither we nor the savaged will survive it .
i see the governor appreciates the signs less than yee , his godly advisors .
it is not always easy .
strangely , the same thing happened in virginia .
before the attack , there were signs that went unheeded .
what manner of signs ?
the bad winter .
the crop failures .
far too many quakers and foreigners in the town .
some minor elements of witchcraft , etc .
exactly !
our first sign was that of hester prynne and her women' s meetings .
then the severe winter .
the failed crops .
you see , sir , my colleague has feared from the start , that in the matter of mistress prynne , witchcraft was involved .
then why in all this time have you not taken measures to cleanse your colony ?
what measures do you speak of ?
did you examine the women present at those meetings ?
have you queried the midwife , or inspected the child for the witch' s marks ?
i shall fear no evil .
i prepare us a table in the presence of thine enemy .
my cup runneth over .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me .
i will dwell in the house of the lord .
the babe' s clean , at present .
hester , we shall leave your child with you for the present , but you must assure us it will be raised a christian .
yes , yes .
yes .
i' ve been your friend today .
but it cannot always be so .
no .
for inside me i grow more wretched by the day .
i yearn so much for thee .
i fear i might destroy her whole world to win her back .
tell old harriet what' s troubling you .
i never imagined how cruel and cunning their punishment could be .
stonehall y cheever stop to preach at me in the street .
the people pointing and shouting .
even the children .
and that horrible drummer boy following me everywhere .
perhaps it was all for naught .
i wonder if to be a woman is worthwhile at all .
even for the happiest of women .
courage , child .
take heart .
at least you' ve known what it is to love .
but what if i' ve repaid it by destroying him ?
what if everything i believed so strongly was a lie ?
vain and selfish .
prynne' s cruelpunishments were succeeding .
the seasons ran theircourse .
the distance between them was impassable .
my mother took the terrible risk ofwriting to my father , reminding to keep theirlove and his silence .
the subtle but constant presence ofprynne was a torment that threatened my father' s very soul .
as forprynne , his lust forrevenge fed on itself so that he hungered formore .
good morrow , mituba .
what a pleasant day for a ride .
poor mituba .
you' re renowned for your loyalty to your mistress , and i see why .
was your dry lunch a communication from her lover ?
i have the power to arrest you as an accomplice t adultery and bring you before the magistrates for questioning .
and since you are a slave , they might whip you to death .
easy .
easy .
i only want to help the one we both love .
to free herself from the grasp of a fiend .
dear lord , this is it !
he made you strip naked before him !
totally naked !
was there a presence in the room ?
now think !
think !
he might have come in one of his many disguises .
did he come as a bird ?
oh , god .
i feel the presence of lucifer !
save yourself before it' s too late !
gentlemen , please !
enough !
enough !
go home , mituba .
you' ve been a wondrous help .
commend us to your mistress .
go home .
go home .
so there is a malignancy to be cut our here .
but what kind of witness will a slave be in court ?
the bird , obviously . is harriet hibbons .
what is it , pearl ?
forgive me , hester .
harriet .
yours was the first place i thought of to hide .
what is it ?
they' ve , they' ve , they' ve ah ... broken into my house .
they' re looking for me in the woods .
i' ve been named as a witch !
ln the name of god !
halt there !
yes , sir !
what' s the meaning of this intrusion ?
stand aside , woman !
we know the witch is in here .
there' s no one inside but me , my child and mituba .
so unless you have a warrant , be gone .
reverend dimmesdale .
what' s happening , major ?
we' ve cornered ourselves a witch .
here in hester prynne' s cottage .
lf there' s a witch inside the house , major ,
i' il find her .
right .
one man at the door .
soldier !
sir ?
pearl' s grown tall .
she' s an elf .
willful .
dear god , hester .
it' s been so long .
you' r thin .
are you hiding someone , hester ?
why do you ... ?
why are you risking further anger from the elders ?
because she is no witch !
she' s committed no crime beyond speaking her mind !
lf she is innocent ,
i assure you no harm will befall her .
arthur .
after all that has happened , how can you still trust these iron men ?
don' t you see what' s happening ?
last month they brought sally short for questioning .
they held her for 2 days .
last week it was mary rollins .
they just questioned them !
what' s the crime in that ?
the crime is they had nothing !
don' t you see this is some malevolence ?
what has become of you ?
god , woman !
what are your demands ?
i' ve given up everything i own sacred !
i' m in hell !
ln the eye of your husband , who lurks at my side day and night .
ln the eye of all who come to me to unburden their soul !
i' m a pollution !
i' m a lie !
they are the pollution !
they are the lie !
but you allow them to destroy all that is good in you !
what' s happened to the man i love ?
does he not still live inside thee ?
our love , woman , was a folly .
and the voice we heard , we have been punished for listening to !
what have i become ?
to betray the onlyperson on earth who had shown herkindness .
what could feel worse than that ?
mituba ?
poor , mute mituba .
when prynne summoned her , she wanted only to undo the harm sh' d caused her mistress .
peace in this house !
peace , i say .
peace !
you find these proceedings humorous , mistress ?
do you expect me to take them seriously ?
you' re a bunch of grown men poking around my private parts looking for witch' s marks !
the slave , mituba ...
peace , i say .
peace !
the witness , the slave mituba , has been found dead .
i told you she was a witch !
mistress hibbons is a witch !
she' s a witch !
witch !
have you lost all reason ?
there' s no witchcraft here !
this is murder !
guards , restrain this woman !
satan is not at work here among the women !
but if he' s here , perhaps is at work among you men !
here satan speaks !
governor ?
i have evidence to render .
as you know ,
mistress hibbons midwifed mistress prynne' s baby pearl .
sweet pearl .
bastard !
no !
pearl .
i wish you were my girl .
poor fatherless child .
would you like to learn a game ?
yes .
now do what i do .
lf i pinch my nose .
you too .
very good , very good .
now , pull up my shirt and show my tummy tum tum .
now show me your tummy tum tum .
pull up your shirt .
behold the witch' s mark !
behold the devil' s own child !
the devil' s own child !
the devil' s own child !
this woman is innocent !
lnnocent ?
since you first spoke of this woman , all we' ve dreames and toiled for in god' s name has been threatened !
i' ve heard enough !
have you listened ?
factions !
arguments !
dissent !
that is the work of satan !
the town was in an uproar .
my fatherrisked one last meeting with my mother , convinced that ifthey were to hang
harriet , it would not be long before my motherand i would be seized ... and hung .
i had to speak out .
i couldn' t stop myself .
damn your husband !
you and pearl must go in hiding .
tonight .
i cannot .
i cannot run .
what are you saying ?
forgive me .
whatever happens , promise me you' il look after pearl . l .
god , woman , how much further must you take this ?
as far as my strength will take me .
lf harriet is to hang , i must hang with her .
i' il ask the other women to stand with us .
they can' t hang us all .
hester , are we ever to know a life together ?
i love thee .
i love thee and always will .
i will always love thee .
lord god , we stood before thee naked once , and now we stand before thee naked again , as a family .
god !
thou has given me this as a gift , and i will not give it up !
not while i have the strength .
arthur ?
arthur ?
arthur ?
evening mistress prynne .
expecting someone else ?
ah , no .
didn' t you call out for arthur ?
the only arthur i know is ...
dimmesdale .
you misunderstood me , i didn' t say ...
i should have guessed long ago .
you naughty girl .
so you fucked our minister .
god , i' m about to savour a priceless morsel !
up we go !
did he suck your breasts ?
did he lick you ?
where did he lick you ?
show me !
how i wanted to put it in you !
this is to make you pay for my fantasies .
while you were torturing me , you were giving it to another .
damned witch !
get out !
do up your britches and get out !
bastard !
get out of here !
how i will enjoy watching you and the pastor hang !
open up , doctor !
there are matters between us we must discus immediately .
so , arthur dimmesdale .
at last justice is done !
ha sido asesinado !
call out the militia !
call out the guards !
it' s a sign !
the lord has sent us a sign !
we have strayed !
see how he punishes us !
it' s brewster .
those savages have killed him !
my son !
my son !
damned heathens !
lock up the praying lndians , before they murder us in our beds !
get the praying lndians !
praying lndians into the compound !
we are loyal to you !
we are loyal to you !
by order of the governor of the massachusetts bay colony , you are under arrest for the crime of heresy .
stop this .
it was one of us who killed brewster .
i have proof .
bastard !
johnny , run to metacomet' s place by the river .
tell him to come and save his people .
run , man !
here come the witches !
open the cell .
never mind the child .
pearl !
get in , woman !
pearl ?
worry not , mistress .
i' il see she' s raised up to fear the lord .
open up , murderer !
there is no witchcraft here !
lf we hang these women , then what have we become ?
who are we to condemn on god' s behalf ?
i love this woman .
i am the father of her child .
and in god' s eyes ,
i am her husband .
lf you must hang someone , to appease your anger and fear , then hang me .
hang him !
hang him !
hang him !
hang him !
bastards !
hester !
where' s my daughter , pearl ?
she' s in the meeting house !
you are free , my people .
go back to metacomet !
go back to the forest !
bellingham will do anything to conceal this madness from england .
he has sworn to me that he will remove the letter .
and make thee a public apology .
how close they are , love and hate .
we' re no less bound by one than the other .
rest in peace , roger prynne .
this letter has served a purpose .
though not the one they had intended .
so why would i stay here ?
to be accepted by them ?
to be tamed by them ?
there is no perfect world .
no , not perfect .
but we came here to make a new one .
and for pearl' s sake ,
i must do just that .
hester .
hester !
look at me .
lf i look at you , i won' t be able to leave
then leave .
brave the wilds !
but hester ,
i' m not letting you go without me .
they' re watching us .
in the faraway carolinas , they were at last to find a measure ofthe happiness that hade been denied them forso long .
my fatherdied before i reached my teens .
some say that was a punishment .
my motherneverremarried norloved another .
some say that was a punishment .
as forme ,
i do not see it that way .
myparents shared a love like no other .
i know the spirit ofthat love lives within me .
and will live within my children forever .
who is to say what is a sin in god' s eyes ?
